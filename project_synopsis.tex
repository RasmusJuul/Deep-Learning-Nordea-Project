\section*{motivation}
Deep learning is to an increasing degree being used within all fields where data is a crucial part of gaining an advantage over your competitors. The financial business sector is a sector where deep learning can be used to a great extent, with potentially very high reward. 
The potential gains by being able to create a neural network that can predict the revenue of a company somewhere in the future could make for better abilities in issuing loans, potential changes in company value etc.

\section*{background}
Predicting company revenue can help with investing.

Creating and optimizing a neural network to succesfully forecast the revenue of a company given publicly accessible data. The forecast should work with a margin(confidence interval) of the forecast.

\section*{milestones}
Making a neural network that functions.
Optimize on the network to achieve good predictions.
Report the findings.
