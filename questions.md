Questions for Orest and Rufus.

Explain the data, and what they expect us to get from it. (Multiple reports for each year).
What is the context of the reports?
A lot of missing values within the data. Do they have some general advice when getting the data?
Which measurements make sense. Right now we are using 5(gross result, Gross-profit-loss, profit-loss, revenue, Assets)

Explain our idea of how to structure the data, does it make sense, or are we over/under complicating it?

What is "disclosure of accounting policies". Show them the data we get, and ask for their expertise in
determining what the stuff actually is.

It seems like the companies report different stuff for profit-loss, gross-profit-loss etc. Is there a way to calculate one from another
so that we can "create" the full picture, from what we have.
