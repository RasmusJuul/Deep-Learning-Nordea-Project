The equity amounts to DKK 74,805k as of 31.12.2016.","In 2016, the Entity has presented its financial statements with an income statement classified by nature. The financial statements for 2015 were presented with an income statement classified by function. The change from an income statement classified by function to an income statement classified by nature ensures a presentation that is more consistent with the Group's other companies.
