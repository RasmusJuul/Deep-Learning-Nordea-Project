Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.
