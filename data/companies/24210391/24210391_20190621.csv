Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report. Gross Profit includes net turnover, change in inventories, cost of material and other external costs.  <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group. As a consolidated entity, the Company has unlimited and joint liability together with the other companies under joint taxation for Danish corporation tax and withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties within the jointly taxed companies.   <br/>  2018 2017<br/>  DKK DKK<br/>Other financial obligation   <br/>Rent payment   100.610   97.680 <br/>   100.610   97.680 <br/>","Number Nominal Value<br/>   DKK<br/>   <br/>Shares at DKK 5,000   100   500.000 <br/>   <br/>    500.000 <br/>There have been changes in the share capital during the current year.   <br/>   <br/>",Staff expenses  2018 2017<br/>  DKK DKK<br/>   <br/>Wages and salaries   1.611.109   1.945.415 <br/>Pensions   101.743   123.361 <br/>Other social security expenses   6.149   6.059 <br/>   1.719.001   2.074.835 <br/>,Financial assets  2018 2017<br/>  DKK DKK<br/>   <br/>Deposits   <br/>Cost at 1 January   24.421   14.227 <br/>Adjustment during the year   732   10.194 <br/>Carrying amount at 31 December   25.153   24.421 <br/>   <br/>,"Related parties and ownership   <br/>Transactions   <br/>The company's related parties are Honeywell International Inc and its subsidiaries.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report.

It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report.

It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report. Gross Profit includes net turnover, change in inventories, cost of material and other external costs.  <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report. Gross Profit includes net turnover, change in inventories, cost of material and other external costs.  <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report. Gross Profit includes net turnover, change in inventories, cost of material and other external costs.  <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report.

It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report.

There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>Danish kroner is used as the measurement currency. All other currencies are regarded as foreign currencies. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains and losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. Where foreign exchange transactions are considered hedging of future cash flows, the value adjustments are recognised directly in equity. <br/>Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Any differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in ï¬nancial income and expenses in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Income Statement <br/> <br/>Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Gross profit <br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, revenue is not disclosed in the annual report.

It comprises of operation and administration cost.  <br/> <br/>Distribution expenses <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Administrative expenses <br/>Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to administrative activities. <br/> <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with the Danish subsidiaries in the Honeywell group. The tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to Danish enterprises in proportion to their taxable incomes. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Balance Sheet <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Deferred income <br/>Deferred income comprises payments received in respect of income in subsequent years. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual liability in respect of finance leases.  <br/> <br/>Financial liabilities <br/>Other debts are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to nominal value. <br/>","Contingent assets, liabilities and other financial obligations   <br/>   <br/>The Company is jointly taxed with all other Danish companies in the Honeywell group.
