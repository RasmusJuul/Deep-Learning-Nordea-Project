These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns.

We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period.

Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions.

We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management.

Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns.

We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns.

We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management.

In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.

Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns.

We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management.

In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.

Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns.

We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management.

In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit.

Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the ""Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures also covered evaluating the assumptions applied by Management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and third parties. Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand. Further, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">In our opinion, the Managementâs Review includes a true and fair review of the development in the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs operations and financial conditions, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, as well as a description of the more significant risks and uncertainty facing the Group and the Parent Company.</td></tr></table>",Jacob HjortshÃ¸j,Ernst & Young Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab,Pandora A/S,Ernst & Young,"<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">OUR OPINION</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of PANDORA A/S for the financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Group as well as the Parent Company.

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue and sales return</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair value of the expected consideration to be received, less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected sales returns. Revenue recognition and measurement of the related expected sales returns was a matter of most significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the estimates and judgements which Management makes in the normal course of business as to timing of revenue and measurement of expected sales returns. Details on revenue recognition and expected sales returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.5 of the consolidated financial statements and in section 3.6 of the parent company financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns included considering the Groupâs accounting policies for revenue recognition, including those related to expected sales returns, and assessing compliance of  policies with applicable accounting standards. We identified and assessed internal controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of expected sales returns. We tested the effectiveness of the Groupâs internal controls in relation to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of revenue recognition. On a sample basis, we tested sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess whether those transactions were recognised in the correct period. We assessed the key assumptions applied by Management regarding expected sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by Management. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures provided by Management in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements to applicable accounting standards.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Taxation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business, Management makes judgements and estimates in determining the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions. In Thailand, the Group is subject to Board of Investment agreements (BOIs), where many, but not all, types of net income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes in profit allocation could significantly impact the Groupâs consolidated tax expense. On this basis, taxation was a matter of most significance in our audit. Additional details on income taxes are provided in section 2.5 of the consolidated financial statements, to which we refer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our procedures in relation to recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncertain tax positions included assessing the Groupâs processes for recording and continual re-assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.

Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groupâs correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax provisions. We also assessed the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialistsâ knowledge and experience. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by Management from third parties related to the requirements for tax exemptions under BOIs in Thailand.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
