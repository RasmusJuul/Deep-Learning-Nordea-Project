Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users of accounting information taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. <br/><br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our<br/>    auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to<br/>    modify our opinion.
