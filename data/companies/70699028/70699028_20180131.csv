The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/><br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3-5 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 10 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the FIFO method. Where the net<br/>realisable value is lower than cost, inventories are written down to this lower value.<br/><br/>Goods for resale are measured at cost, comprising purchase price plus delivery costs.<br/><br/>Provisions are made for obsolete and slow-moving items.<br/><br/>Prepayments and deferred income<br/>Prepayments comprise prepayment of costs incurred relating to subsequent financial<br/>years.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost.<br/><br/>Write-down is made for bad debt losses where there is an objective indication that a<br/>receivable has been impaired. If there is an objective indication that an individual<br/>receivable has been impaired, write-down is made on an individual basis.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Proposed dividends are recognised as a liability at the date on which they are<br/>adopted at the annual general meeting (declaration date). The expected dividend<br/>payment for the year is disclosed as a seperate item under equity.<br/><br/>Corporation tax and deferred tax<br/>Under the joint taxation rules, the Company's liabilities in respect of the tax authorities<br/>for the corporation tax is settled concurrently with the payment of the joint taxation<br/>contributions to the administrative company.<br/><br/>Joint tax contribution is recognised in the balance sheet in separate balance sheet<br/>items.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary<br/>differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are recognised<br/>at the expected value of their utilisation within the foreseeable future; either as a setoff<br/>against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the<br/>same legal tax entity. Any deferred net assets are measured at net realisable value.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates<br/>applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise<br/>as current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are<br/>recognised in the income statement or equity, respectively.<br/><br/>Liabilities<br/>Liabilities are measured at amortized cost which normally corresponds to net<br/>realisable value.","Revenue<br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when<br/>transfer of risk to the buyer has taken place and provided that the income can be<br/>reliably measured and is expected to be received.<br/><br/>Gross margin<br/>Gross margin comprises the value of revenue less cost of sales directly attributable to<br/>the sale and other external costs.<br/><br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>Financial income and expenses comprise interest and realised and unrealised foreign<br/>exchange adjustments.<br/><br/>Tax on profit/loss for the year<br/>The Company is subject to the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the<br/>Group's Danish subsidiaries.

Entities with tax<br/>losses receive joint taxation contributions from entities that have used the losses to<br/>reduce their own taxable profit.<br/><br/>Tax for the year comprises current corporation tax for the year and changes in<br/>deferred tax, including changes in tax rates. The tax expense relating to the profit/loss<br/>for the year is recognised in the income statement, and the tax expense relating to<br/>amounts directly recognised in equity is recognised directly in equity.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)<br/>and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.
