Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not recognised<br/>in cost.<br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they<br/>are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.<br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the useful life. Depreciation<br/>is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 - 5 years<br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as accounting estimates,<br/>and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the<br/>selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the date of disposal. Gains and losses are<br/>recognised in the income statement as other operating income or other operating costs, respectively.<br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the FIFO method.

Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not recognised<br/>in cost.<br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they<br/>are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.<br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the useful life. Depreciation<br/>is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.

Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not recognised<br/>in cost.<br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they<br/>are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.<br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the useful life. Depreciation<br/>is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 - 5 years<br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as accounting estimates,<br/>and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the<br/>selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the date of disposal. Gains and losses are<br/>recognised in the income statement as other operating income or other operating costs, respectively.<br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the FIFO method.

Goodwill is amortised<br/>on a straight-line basis over its useful life.<br/>Capitalised development costs are measured at the lower of cost less accumulated amortisation or<br/>recoverable amount.<br/>Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life after<br/>completion of the development work.<br/>Property, plant and equipment<br/>Land and buildings, plant and machinery and fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment are measured at cost<br/>less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.<br/>Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date on<br/>which the asset is available for use. Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not recognised<br/>in cost.<br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they<br/>are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.<br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the useful life. Depreciation<br/>is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 - 5 years<br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as accounting estimates,<br/>and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the<br/>selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the date of disposal. Gains and losses are<br/>recognised in the income statement as other operating income or other operating costs, respectively.<br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the FIFO method. Where the net realisable value is<br/>lower than cost, inventories are written down to this lower value.<br/>Goods for resale and raw materials and consumables are measured at cost, comprising purchase price plus<br/>delivery costs.<br/>Finished goods and work in progress are measured at cost, comprising the cost of raw materials,<br/>consumables, direct wages and salaries. Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not<br/>recognised in cost.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the sales amount less costs of completion and costs<br/>necessary to make the sale and is determined taking into account marketability, obsolescence and<br/>development in expected selling price.<br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost.<br/>Write-down is made for bad debt losses where there is an objective indication that a receivable has been<br/>impaired.

However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences<br/>relating to office buildings non-deductible for tax purposes and other items where temporary differences<br/>arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either profit/loss or taxable income.<br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carry forwards, are recognised at the expected value<br/>of their utilisation within the foreseeable future; either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a setoff<br/>against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity. Any deferred net assets are measured at net<br/>realisable value.<br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates applicable at the balance<br/>sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a<br/>result of changes in tax rates are recognised in the income statement or equity, respectively.<br/>Liabilities other than provisions<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at cost, corresponding to the proceeds received<br/>less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost,<br/>corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between<br/>cost and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan together with<br/>interest expenses.<br/>Other liabilities are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/>Deferred income<br/>Deferred income comprises payments received regarding income in subsequent years.","Gross profit<br/>With reference to section 32 of Danish Financial Statements Act revenue, cost of sales and other external<br/>costs are aggregated in the financial statement caption Gross profit<br/>Revenue<br/>Income from the sale of goods, comprising the sale of 2018, is recognised in revenue when delivery and<br/>transfer of risk to the buyer have taken place, and the income may be measured reliably and is expected to<br/>be received.<br/>Income from agreements from maintenance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the<br/>agreement.<br/>Engineering and consultancy services are recognised as work is performed.<br/>Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration excluding VAT and taxes charged on<br/>behalf of third parties. All discounts granted are deducted from revenue.<br/>Cost of sales<br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to generate revenue for the year. This item also comprises direct<br/>costs for goods for resale and changes to inventory of goods for resale.<br/>Other external costs<br/>Other external costs comprise costs for distribution and sales costs, costs for advertising, administrative<br/>expenses, costs of premises, bad debts, operating leases, etc.<br/>Staff costs<br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries, including holiday allowance, pension and other social security<br/>costs, excluding reimbursements from public authorities.<br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>Financial income and expenses comprise interest income and expense, financial costs regarding, gains and<br/>losses on securities, payables and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, amortisation of financial<br/>assets and liabilities as well as surcharges and refunds under the on-account tax scheme, etc.<br/>Tax on profit for the year<br/>Tax for the year comprises current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax, including changes in tax<br/>rates.
