Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.

Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life.<br/>Capitalised development costs are measured at the lower of cost less accumulated amortisation or recoverable amount.<br/>Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life after completion of the development work.<br/>Property, plant and equipment<br/>Land and buildings, plant and machinery and fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. <br/>Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date on which the asset is available for use. Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.<br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 - 5 years<br/> <br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the date of disposal. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement as other operating income or other operating costs, respectively.<br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the FIFO method. Where the net realisable value is lower than cost, inventories are written down to this lower value.<br/>Goods for resale and raw materials and consumables are measured at cost, comprising purchase price plus delivery costs.<br/>Finished goods and work in progress are measured at cost, comprising the cost of raw materials, consumables, direct wages and salaries. Indirect production overheads and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the sales amount less costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale and is determined taking into account marketability, obsolescence and development in expected selling price.<br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost.<br/>Write-down is made for bad debt losses where there is an objective indication that a receivable has been impaired. If there is an objective indication that an individual receivable has been impaired, write-down is made on an individual basis.<br/>Prepayments<br/>Prepayments comprise prepayment of costs incurred relating to subsequent financial years.<br/>Equity <br/>Dividends<br/>The expected dividend payment for the year is disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/>Corporation tax and deferred tax<br/>Current tax payable and receivable is recognised in the balance sheet as tax computed on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax on the taxable income of prior years and for tax paid on account.<br/>Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax value of assets and liabilities measured on the planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively. However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to office buildings non-deductible for tax purposes and other items where temporary differences arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either profit/loss or taxable income. <br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carry forwards, are recognised at the expected value of their utilisation within the foreseeable future; either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity. Any deferred net assets are measured at net realisable value.<br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised in the income statement or equity, respectively.<br/>Liabilities other than provisions<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at cost, corresponding to the proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between cost and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan together with interest expenses.<br/>Other liabilities are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/>Deferred income<br/>Deferred income comprises payments received regarding income in subsequent years.","Gross profit<br/>With reference to section 32 of Danish Financial Statements Act revenue, cost of sales and other external costs are aggregated in the financial statement caption Gross profit <br/>Revenue<br/>Income from the sale of goods, comprising the sale of 2017, is recognised in revenue when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have taken place, and the income may be measured reliably and is expected to be received.<br/>Income from agreements from maintenance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreement. <br/>Engineering and consultancy services are recognised as work is performed.<br/>Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration excluding VAT and taxes charged on behalf of third parties. All discounts granted are deducted from revenue.<br/>Cost of sales<br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to generate revenue for the year. This item also comprises direct costs for goods for resale and changes to inventory of goods for resale.<br/>Other external costs<br/>Other external costs comprise costs for distribution and sales costs, costs for advertising, administrative expenses, costs of premises, bad debts, operating leases, etc.<br/>Staff costs<br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries, including holiday allowance, pension and other social security costs, excluding reimbursements from public authorities.<br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>Financial income and expenses comprise interest income and expense, financial costs regarding, gains and losses on securities, payables and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, amortisation of financial assets and liabilities as well as surcharges and refunds under the on-account tax scheme, etc.<br/>Tax on profit for the year <br/>Tax for the year comprises current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax, including changes in tax rates.
