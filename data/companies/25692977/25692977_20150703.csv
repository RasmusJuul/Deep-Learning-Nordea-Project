We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements are  free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that give  a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.","Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.","Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the management commentary.
