The Chairman and Vice Chairman<br/>typically nominate new members for the Board. In circumstances in<br/>which specific research skills are required, nomination takes place in collaboration<br/>with the Chairman of the Foundationâs Research and Prize committee.<br/>External advisors are usually called in to assist with the selection process.<br/><br/>2.3.3<br/>It is recommended<br/>that members of the board of directors are appointed based on their personal<br/>qualities and competences considering the collective competences of the<br/>board and when composing and nominating new members of the board the<br/>need for introducing new talent is weighed against the need for continuity<br/>and the need for diversity is considered in relation to commercial and grants<br/>experience, age and gender.<br/><br/>We comply<br/>The Board is composed such that the combined knowledge and experience of<br/>its members ensures the fulfilment of Lundbeckfondenâs objectives, as specified<br/>in the statutes.<br/><br/>2.3.4<br/>It is recommended<br/>that in the management review in the annual report and on the commercial<br/>foundation's website, there is an account of the composition of the board of<br/>directors, including its diversity, and that the following information is provided<br/>on each board member:<br/>â¢ the name and position of the member,<br/>â¢ the age and gender of the member,<br/>â¢ date of original appointment to the board whether the member has been<br/>re-elected, and expiry of the current election period,<br/>â¢ any special competences possessed by the member,<br/>â¢ other managerial positions held by the member, including positions on<br/>executive boards, boards of directors and supervisory boards and board<br/>committees in Danish and foreign foundations, enterprises and institutions,<br/>as well as other demanding organisation tasks,<br/>â¢ whether the member has been appointed by authorities/providers of<br/>grants etc., and<br/>â¢ whether the member is considered independent.<br/><br/>We comply<br/>An overview of the competition of the Board of Directors is presented in<br/>the Management Report 2016 and on Lundbeckfondenâs website.<br/><br/>No authority or similar body has the power to appoint members to<br/>the Board.<br/><br/>2.3.5<br/>It is recommended<br/>that the majority of the members of the board of directors of the commercial<br/>foundation are not also members of the board of directors or executive board<br/>of the foundation's subsidiary(ies), unless it is a fully owned actual holding<br/>company.<br/><br/>We comply<br/>The majority of the members of Lundbeckfondenâs Board are not also members<br/>of the boards of our subsidiaries, just as the Board is not represented on<br/>the executive management teams of the subsidiaries.<br/><br/>The Foundation is represented by two members on the boards of our subsidiaries.<br/>One of these members is our CEO, who serves as Vice Chairman on<br/>these boards.

According to the statues,<br/>a board member is elected for one year at a time â adopting best practice<br/>from listed companies. This allows for regular evaluation of a memberâs performance.<br/><br/>No member who has been a member of the Board for more than 12 years can<br/>be re-elected.<br/><br/>The Board may deviate from this rule if the Boardâs competence profile dictates<br/>it.

The<br/>remuneration should reflect the work and responsibilities consequential to<br/>the position.<br/><br/>We comply<br/>Members of the Board and management are remunerated by a fixed fee. This<br/>fee does not depend on the financial results of the subsidiaries nor on our<br/>other investment activities.<br/><br/>Members of our research and investment committees â as well as the board<br/>members of our subsidiaries â receive an additional fee in proportion to their<br/>workload.<br/><br/>3.2<br/>It is recommended<br/>that the annual financial statements provide information about the full<br/>remuneration received by each member of the board of directors and executive<br/>board (if relevant) from the commercial foundation and from other<br/>enterprises in the group. Furthermore, there should be information on any<br/>other remuneration which members of the board of directors, except for<br/>employee representatives, have received for performing tasks for the foundation,<br/>subsidiaries of the foundation or enterprises in the same group as the<br/>foundation.<br/><br/>We comply<br/>Information on the total sum paid in remuneration to members of the Board<br/>and the CEO is specified in Lundbeckfondenâs Annual Report 2016.",2017-04-19,State Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the<br/>additional requirements applicable in Denmark.
