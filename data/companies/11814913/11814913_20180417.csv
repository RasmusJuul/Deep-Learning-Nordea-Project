This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exits. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements.<br/><br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:<br/>â¢ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the Foundation financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.<br/>â¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groupâs and the Foundationâs internal control.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.<br/>â¢ Conclude on the appropriateness of Managementâs use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Foundationâs ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorâs report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Foundation to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/>â¢ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The foundation acknowledges the responsibilities that this entails and makes an effort to ensure that it is recognised as a trustworthy organisation, setting itself high standards for transparency, commitment and integrity.<br/><br/>The foundation has supported and been committed to the UN Global Compact since 2012. Consequently, the Compactâs ten principles form the general framework upon which the foundationâs approach to corporate social responsibility is based. The foundation opposes any form of corruption, including <br/>extortion and bribery. Furthermore, it follows the UN Global Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market <br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development. <br/><br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own specific CSR policies, including human rights, climate change, environmental impact, and codes of conduct. Lundbeck has signed up to the UN Global Compact whereas both ALK and Falck follow the guidelines without having formally joined the initiative.","Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the Foundation financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Groupâs and the Foundationâs ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Foundation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","It is the policy of the Lundbeck Foundation to support gender equality and diversity.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees counts two women and five men among its members, excluding employee representatives. This constitutes gender balance in accordance with the guidelines on gender equality issued by the Danish Business Authority (âGuidelines on Target figures, policies and reporting on the gender composition of managementâ).<br/><br/>The foundation has ensured that all subsidiaries which fall under the requirements for reporting classes âlarge Câ or âDâ have set targets for their top management body individually. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the foundationâs subsidiaries have reported on their individual targets in their annual reports, as well as on their individual policies concerning gender balance at other management levels, if applicable.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO.

The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria.

The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore, it follows the UN Global Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market <br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development. <br/><br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own specific CSR policies, including human rights, climate change, environmental impact, and codes of conduct.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark.

Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence.

The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications.

This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria.

This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO.

Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria.

The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines.

Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance.

The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance.

The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO.

The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee.

The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements.

Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corporations and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of <br/>responsibility. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Consequently, it has high standards of governance and follows all recommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the foundationâs compliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore there is always both in the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and in the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the foundation a majority of independent members. Furthermore according to our Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of neither the foundation nor of its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the foundation. This ensures long term checks and balances in the superior management of an organisation that is not under control of any shareholders or other owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Define the foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants, based on recommendations from the committees<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the foundation is managed appropriately, in accordance with applicable law and the foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet up regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the foundation is actively <br/>involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management and boards. The foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives. <br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for allocation of research funding are that the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the applicant, and the academic environment at the host institution must all be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant applications must be peer reviewed by a group of experts, the majority of whom must be unconnected to the foundation. Two permanent evaluation committees, comprising a majority of external and international experts, have been set up to assess regular project applications. Ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to <br/>assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of both types of panel must comply with the foundationâs rules on the disqualification of members.<br/><br/>For The Brain Prize, an independent Selection Committee reports to the Lundbeck Foundation Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee. The latter ensures that the recommendation complies with the Brain Prize provisions. <br/> <br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in accordance with statutory requirements. The foundation is developing a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This adjustment will only apply to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. The model has been approved by the Danish Business Authority and is expected to be implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommendations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the developments and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br/>FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The foundation expects researchers who receive funding to conduct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for research funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from The Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good research practice, and that the grant holder complies with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2018-04-17,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exits. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements.<br/><br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:<br/>â¢ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the Foundation financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.<br/>â¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groupâs and the Foundationâs internal control.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.<br/>â¢ Conclude on the appropriateness of Managementâs use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Foundationâs ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorâs report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Foundation to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/>â¢ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The foundation acknowledges the responsibilities that this entails and makes an effort to ensure that it is recognised as a trustworthy organisation, setting itself high standards for transparency, commitment and integrity.<br/><br/>The foundation has supported and been committed to the UN Global Compact since 2012. Consequently, the Compactâs ten principles form the general framework upon which the foundationâs approach to corporate social responsibility is based. The foundation opposes any form of corruption, including <br/>extortion and bribery. Furthermore, it follows the UN Global Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market <br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development. <br/><br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own specific CSR policies, including human rights, climate change, environmental impact, and codes of conduct. Lundbeck has signed up to the UN Global Compact whereas both ALK and Falck follow the guidelines without having formally joined the initiative.","Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the Foundation financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Groupâs and the Foundationâs ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Foundation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","It is the policy of the Lundbeck Foundation to support gender equality and diversity.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees counts two women and five men among its members, excluding employee representatives. This constitutes gender balance in accordance with the guidelines on gender equality issued by the Danish Business Authority (âGuidelines on Target figures, policies and reporting on the gender composition of managementâ).<br/><br/>The foundation has ensured that all subsidiaries which fall under the requirements for reporting classes âlarge Câ or âDâ have set targets for their top management body individually. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the foundationâs subsidiaries have reported on their individual targets in their annual reports, as well as on their individual policies concerning gender balance at other management levels, if applicable.
