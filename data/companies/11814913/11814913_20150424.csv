The procedures selected depend on the auditorâs<br/>judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material<br/>misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the<br/>Foundationâs financial statements, whether due to fraud or<br/>error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers<br/>internal control relevant to the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements and the Foundationâs financial statements<br/>that give a true and fair view in order to design procedures<br/>that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express<br/>an opinion on the effectiveness of the entityâs internal control.<br/>An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting<br/>policies used and the reasonableness of accounting<br/>estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the<br/>overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements<br/>and the Foundationâs financial statements.<br/>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient<br/>and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.<br/>Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.","Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards<br/>as adopted by the EU and Danish disclosure requirements for<br/>annual reports as well as the preparation of financial statements<br/>of the Foundation that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for<br/>such internal control as Management determines is necessary<br/>to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements<br/>and financial statements of the Foundation that are free from<br/>material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.","Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have<br/>read the management review. We have not performed any<br/>further procedures in addition to the audit of the consolidated<br/>financial statements and the Foundationâs financial statements.<br/>On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in<br/>the management review is consistent with the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the Foundationâs financial statements.",RevisionspÃ¥tegning,urn:ofk:oid:5158412,indberetninger-20180424,2.363722,11814913,,2018-03-30T12:30:31.017Z,2015-04-24T13:43:02.868Z,regnskab,0.0,,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,X15-AB-03-KQ,2015-04-24T13:43:03.112Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59588000000.0,458000000.0,4753000000.0,14722000000.0,13097000000.0,582000000.0,870000000.0,623000000.0,6455000000.0,205000000.0,571000000.0,190000000.0,97000000.0,1951000000.0,983000000.0,1779000000.0,33023000000.0,59588000000.0,28354000000.0,13245000000.0,1452000000.0,11384000000.0,22510000000.0,8335000000.0,2485000000.0,78000000.0,2728000000.0,26565000000.0,375000000.0,4669000000.0,44866000000.0,16012000000.0,13468000000.0,9572000000.0,1714000000.0,10720000000.0,840000000.0,254000000.0,28000000.0,939000000.0,6344000000.0,24687000000.0,251000000.0,320000000.0,6265000000.0,,
