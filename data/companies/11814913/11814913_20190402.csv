This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the addi-tional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exits. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggre-gate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements.<br/><br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:<br/>â¢ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the Foundation financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a ba-sis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, mis-representations, or the override of internal control.<br/>â¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the ef-fectiveness of the Groupâs and the Foundationâs internal control.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting esti-mates and related disclosures made by Management.<br/> <br/>â¢ Conclude on the appropriateness of Managementâs use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Foundationâs ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorâs report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Foundation to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/>â¢ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or busi-ness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely re-sponsible for our audit opinion.<br/><br/>We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.","Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at the Lundbeck Foundation is guided by the Foundationâs clear commitment to making a positive impact on society through its investments in business and science at the frontiers of their fields.<br/><br/>As an international player with a broad range of investment activi-ties and grants, the Lundbeck Foundation has a significant influ-ence on society. The Foundation acknowledges the responsibilities that this entails and makes an effort to ensure that it is recognised as a trustworthy organisation, setting itself high standards for transparency, commitment and integrity.<br/><br/>The Foundation has supported and been committed to the UN Global Compact since 2012 and is the only private industrial Foundation in Denmark to do so. Consequently, the Compactâs 10 principles form the general framework upon which the Founda-tionâs approach to CSR is based. <br/><br/>The UN Sustainable Development Goals address the global chal-lenges, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. The goals aim to set the world on a course for a more sustainable future by 2030. The Foundation wants to do its part and will, during 2019, explore the possibilities of addressing a range of selected Sustainable Development Goals. While there is an obvious and immediate connection to the goals that are connected to science, health and education, the Foundation will also look to expand its focus to include the goals <br/>related to commercial activities and partnerships.<br/><br/>The Foundation opposes any form of corruption, including extor-tion and bribery. Furthermore, it follows the UN Global  Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market<br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development.<br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own <br/>specific CSR policies, including on human rights, climate change, environmental impact and codes of conduct. Lundbeck and Falck have signed up to the UN Global Compact, whereas ALK follows the guidelines without having <br/>formally joined the initiative. <br/><br/> LEARN MORE ABOUT CSR AT <br/>THE LUNDBECK FOUNDATION GROUP<br/><br/>For more information about Lundbeck, ALK and Falckâs <br/>approaches to CSR, please visit their websites.<br/><br/>For the Lundbeck Foundationâs statutory statement <br/>on CSR in accordance with section 99a of the <br/>Danish Financial Statements Act, please refer to:<br/><br/>https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/csr-report","Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and addi-tional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.<br/>â<br/>In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the Foundation financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Groupâs and the Foundationâs ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Foundation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","It is the policy of the Lundbeck Foundation to support gender equality and diversity. The Foundation is currently working on a diversity policy which is expected to be reviewed and <br/>approved by the Board of Trustees in 2019.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees counts two women and five men among its members, excluding employee representatives. This constitutes gender balance in accordance with the guidelines on <br/>gender equality issued by the Danish Business Authority (âGuide-lines on target figures, policies and reporting on the gender compo-sition of managementâ).<br/><br/>At management level, the Foundation aims to have a mix of men and women that reflects the gender distribution in the rest of the organisation. Among the management team of six, three are men and three are women.<br/><br/>The Foundation has also ensured that all subsidiaries which fall under the requirements for the reporting classes âlarge Câ or âDâ have set gender-balance targets for their top management teams.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Foundationâs subsidiaries have reported on their individual targets in their own annual reports, as well as on their individual policies concerning gender balance at other management levels, if applicable.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

The goals aim to set the world on a course for a more sustainable future by 2030. The Foundation wants to do its part and will, during 2019, explore the possibilities of addressing a range of selected Sustainable Development Goals. While there is an obvious and immediate connection to the goals that are connected to science, health and education, the Foundation will also look to expand its focus to include the goals <br/>related to commercial activities and partnerships.<br/><br/>The Foundation opposes any form of corruption, including extor-tion and bribery. Furthermore, it follows the UN Global  Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market<br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development.<br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own <br/>specific CSR policies, including on human rights, climate change, environmental impact and codes of conduct.

The Foundation acknowledges the responsibilities that this entails and makes an effort to ensure that it is recognised as a trustworthy organisation, setting itself high standards for transparency, commitment and integrity.<br/><br/>The Foundation has supported and been committed to the UN Global Compact since 2012 and is the only private industrial Foundation in Denmark to do so. Consequently, the Compactâs 10 principles form the general framework upon which the Founda-tionâs approach to CSR is based. <br/><br/>The UN Sustainable Development Goals address the global chal-lenges, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. The goals aim to set the world on a course for a more sustainable future by 2030. The Foundation wants to do its part and will, during 2019, explore the possibilities of addressing a range of selected Sustainable Development Goals.

Furthermore, it follows the UN Global  Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market<br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development.<br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own <br/>specific CSR policies, including on human rights, climate change, environmental impact and codes of conduct.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

The goals aim to set the world on a course for a more sustainable future by 2030. The Foundation wants to do its part and will, during 2019, explore the possibilities of addressing a range of selected Sustainable Development Goals. While there is an obvious and immediate connection to the goals that are connected to science, health and education, the Foundation will also look to expand its focus to include the goals <br/>related to commercial activities and partnerships.<br/><br/>The Foundation opposes any form of corruption, including extor-tion and bribery. Furthermore, it follows the UN Global  Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market<br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development.<br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own <br/>specific CSR policies, including on human rights, climate change, environmental impact and codes of conduct.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications.

This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence.

Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

This intent is underlined by a clear governance structure and is reflected in the Foundationâs approach to investments and grants.<br/><br/>Industrial foundations play an important role in Danish <br/>society. With ownership of some of the largest Danish corpora-tions and substantial contributions to Danish research, industrial foundations have considerable influence on social and economic development in Denmark. For the Lundbeck <br/>Foundation, such influence comes with a high level of responsibil-ity. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is committed to transparency in its operations and to conducting its business with integrity. Conse-quently, it has high standards of governance and follows all rec-ommendations issued by Denmarkâs Committee on Foundation Governance. The only exception being a shorter election period for board members than is recommended by the Committee. For a full overview of the Foundationâs com-<br/>pliance with the recommendations cf. section 77a of the Financial Statements Act, please see the Foundationâs website: https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/god-fondsledelse. <br/><br/>The keyword in good governance is independence. Therefore both the Board of Trustees of the Lundbeck Foundation and the Boards of Directors of all subsidiaries of the Foundation operate with a majority of independent members. Furthermore, according to the Foundationâs Rules of Procedure, no present or former senior employees of either the Foundation or its subsidiaries can become members of the Board of the Foundation or the Boards of Direc-tors of the subsidiaries. <br/><br/>This ensures checks and balances through a high degree of <br/>independence which is of particular importance for a foundation which by design is not under control of any legal owners.<br/><br/>THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES <br/>The Lundbeck Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees in collaboration with the CEO. The Boardâs primary responsibilities are to:<br/><br/>â¢ Decide the Foundationâs strategy<br/>â¢ Make all decisions of major significance or of an exceptional nature<br/>â¢ Make final decisions on the allocation of grants<br/>â¢ Supervise the organisation to make sure the Foundation is man-aged appropriately, in accordance with applicable laws and the Foundationâs statutes<br/>â¢ Appoint the Foundationâs CEO<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees meets a minimum of four times each year for board meetings and holds an annual seminar to review, discuss and refine the strategy. <br/><br/>The Board has set up both a Research and Prize Committee, and an Investment Committee. Both committees meet regularly to analyse and discuss issues related to grants and prizes and to discuss investments in greater detail, respectively.<br/><br/>ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES<br/>As the majority shareholder, the Foundation is actively involved with each of the three subsidiaries, monitoring their performance closely and, as a long-term owner, seeking to add value for their executive management teams and boards. The Foundation exerts its influence through board appointments and representation on the companiesâ boards and at their <br/>General Meetings. The CEO of the Lundbeck Foundation sits on the boards of the subsidiaries in the role of Vice Chairman, as one of the Foundationâs two representatives.<br/><br/>GRANT GOVERNANCE<br/>The basic criteria for the allocation of research funding are the scientific content of the application, the qualifications of the appli-cant, and the academic environment at the host institution, all of which must be of a high international standard. <br/><br/>The Lundbeck Foundation seeks to ensure consistent and equal assessment of all applications. Consequently, all significant appli-cations must be peer reviewed by experts, the <br/>majority of whom must be unconnected to the Foundation. The Lundbeck Foundation has established three permanent evaluation committees â the Research and Prize Committee, the Selection Committee for The Brain Prize, and the Science Teaching and Communication Committee â as well as three permanent evaluation panels â the Grants and Prizes Panel, the Talent Panel and the Internationalisation Panel. Furthermore, ad hoc evaluation panels with international experts are established, as required, to assess major personal and strategic applications. The members of the committees and panels must comply with the Foundationâs impar-tiality rules.<br/><br/>The Research and Prize Committee, the Science Teaching and Communication Committee and the Grants and Prizes Panel all report to the Board of Trustees. The Selection Committee for The Brain Prize reports to the Board of Trustees through the Research and Prize Committee to ensure that its recommendations comply with the provisions for The Brain Prize.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees decides on the allocation of grants in ac-cordance with statutory requirements. However, the Foundation has developed a model whereby the Board, as part of its decision-making on the allocation of grants, can issue a grant mandate to a committee, formed by the Board, to implement the Boardâs grant decisions. This only applies to smaller grants that can be assessed according to specific, standardised criteria. This model has been approved by the Danish Business <br/>Authority and was implemented during 2018.<br/><br/>In general, assessment procedures for applications and recommen-dations are adjusted on an ongoing basis to accommodate the development and implementation of new initiatives.<br/> <br/>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESEARCH GRANTS<br/>All grant holders must comply with the Lundbeck Foundationâs General Terms and Conditions for Research Grants. <br/><br/>The Foundation expects researchers who receive funding to con-duct their research according to recognised codes of good research practice, including the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Scienceâs Code of Conduct for Research <br/>Integrity, the Medical Research Councilâs Good Research Practice, and the International Society for Pharmaco-<br/>epidemiologyâs Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Prac-tice. This also applies to interaction with other researchers, the collection, generation and analysis of data, applications for re-search funding, publication of research results and the recognition of direct and indirect contributions by colleagues, partners and others.<br/><br/> <br/>It is a prerequisite that researchers who receive funding from the Lundbeck Foundation are affiliated with institutions that have their own published codes and guidelines for good <br/>research practice, and that the grant recipients comply with such guidelines. In addition, it is a prerequisite that these <br/>institutions have formally described procedures, which must be adhered to when handling any suspicion of scientific <br/>dishonesty.<br/><br/>To be eligible to receive a grant from the Foundation, the grant holder and the host institution, as well as researchers and third parties affiliated with the research project, must also comply with all laws and rules relevant to the research project.",2019-03-28,State-Authorised Public Accountant,"We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the addition-al requirements applicable in Denmark.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the addi-tional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exits. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggre-gate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements.<br/><br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorâs report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Foundation to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/>â¢ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or busi-ness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The Foundation acknowledges the responsibilities that this entails and makes an effort to ensure that it is recognised as a trustworthy organisation, setting itself high standards for transparency, commitment and integrity.<br/><br/>The Foundation has supported and been committed to the UN Global Compact since 2012 and is the only private industrial Foundation in Denmark to do so. Consequently, the Compactâs 10 principles form the general framework upon which the Founda-tionâs approach to CSR is based. <br/><br/>The UN Sustainable Development Goals address the global chal-lenges, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. The goals aim to set the world on a course for a more sustainable future by 2030. The Foundation wants to do its part and will, during 2019, explore the possibilities of addressing a range of selected Sustainable Development Goals. While there is an obvious and immediate connection to the goals that are connected to science, health and education, the Foundation will also look to expand its focus to include the goals <br/>related to commercial activities and partnerships.<br/><br/>The Foundation opposes any form of corruption, including extor-tion and bribery. Furthermore, it follows the UN Global  Compact guidelines for environmental and labour market<br/>policies, human rights and sustainable development.<br/>The Board of Directors of each subsidiary defines its own <br/>specific CSR policies, including on human rights, climate change, environmental impact and codes of conduct.

The Foundation is currently working on a diversity policy which is expected to be reviewed and <br/>approved by the Board of Trustees in 2019.<br/><br/>The Board of Trustees counts two women and five men among its members, excluding employee representatives. This constitutes gender balance in accordance with the guidelines on <br/>gender equality issued by the Danish Business Authority (âGuide-lines on target figures, policies and reporting on the gender compo-sition of managementâ).<br/><br/>At management level, the Foundation aims to have a mix of men and women that reflects the gender distribution in the rest of the organisation.
