Many of these companies visited the<br/>CBS plant in Aalborg and subsequently evaluated the Hydrofactionâ¢ process and tested the oil produced from<br/>various feed-stocks. As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd. The two entities are jointly and severally liable for the total loan capital. It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,0.0,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.

Many of these companies visited the<br/>CBS plant in Aalborg and subsequently evaluated the Hydrofactionâ¢ process and tested the oil produced from<br/>various feed-stocks. As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd. The two entities are jointly and severally liable for the total loan capital. It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,377738.0,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.

Many of these companies visited the<br/>CBS plant in Aalborg and subsequently evaluated the Hydrofactionâ¢ process and tested the oil produced from<br/>various feed-stocks. As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd. The two entities are jointly and severally liable for the total loan capital. It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,377738.0,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.

As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd.

It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.

In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd.

Many of these companies visited the<br/>CBS plant in Aalborg and subsequently evaluated the Hydrofactionâ¢ process and tested the oil produced from<br/>various feed-stocks. As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd. The two entities are jointly and severally liable for the total loan capital. It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.

Many of these companies visited the<br/>CBS plant in Aalborg and subsequently evaluated the Hydrofactionâ¢ process and tested the oil produced from<br/>various feed-stocks. As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd. The two entities are jointly and severally liable for the total loan capital. It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,0.0,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.

Many of these companies visited the<br/>CBS plant in Aalborg and subsequently evaluated the Hydrofactionâ¢ process and tested the oil produced from<br/>various feed-stocks. As a direct result of interaction with industry players, a 3 months test campaign, and a<br/>third party engineering study of a commercial Hydrofactionâ¢ plant was paid by a global leader in the provision<br/>of pulp, paper and forestry products. The development activities during the year have focused on furthering<br/>our experience with the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology including processing various feedstock<br/>beyond forest residues, designing and installing new process solutions and honing operational protocols. Furthermore,<br/>the Company progressed strategic partnerships with a number potential future licensees of Hydrofaction<br/>â¢ as well as advanced commercialization activities toward the next stage of Hydrofactionâ¢ scale-up.<br/>Development activities<br/>The development project, âHydrofactionâ¢: From Low Value Raw Materials to a Valuable Synthetic Crude<br/>Oilâ, was initiated in 2012 based on support from the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration<br/>Program (EUDP) with a grant of DKK 6.9 million, and a total budget of DKK 10.97 million and was<br/>completed by the end of 2013. The final report was submitted and approved in March 2014.<br/>The development project, âSulphur-Free Marine Fuel Produced from Woodâ which was initiated in November<br/>2013 with Aalborg University as partner and a DKK 539k grant from the Danish Ministry of Science and<br/>Innovation (under the so-called Knowledge Coupon Scheme) was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy continues in its role within the âC3BO- Center for Biooilâ established at Aalborg University<br/>by January 2014 with a DKK 21.8 grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council. The C3BO centre has<br/>participation Aalborg University (DK), Aarhus University (DK), Paul Scherrer Institute (CH), NTHU (N),<br/>Shell (DK) and Canmet Energy (CA). The grant to the company is DKK 750k of a total budget of DKK 2 million<br/>over 4 years.<br/>A new development project, âAdvancement of the Hydrofactionâ¢ Technology Projectâ, was granted by the<br/>Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) with a main goal to mature the<br/>technology to commercial realization through continued testing and development activities using CBS plant.<br/>The project includes a significant upgrade of the existing plant at Aalborg University including increasing its<br/>throughput capacity. The grant totals DKK 17.3 million against a total budgeted cost of DKK 29.5 million. The<br/>project was initiated by July 1st, 2014 and will be executed in cooperation with Aalborg University over a<br/>three-year period. Steeper Energyâs share of the grant amounts to DKK 9.16 million.<br/>In December 2014, the European Commission notified Steeper Energy that the project âResource and Energy<br/>Efficient Conversion of Biomass-to-Hydrocarbon oilâ was shortlisted for a prestigious MEUR 1.848 grant<br/>from its Horizon 2020 SME-Phase 2 program. The Company confirmed the grant in early 2015. The main<br/>objectives of the project is to finalize project siting and other development issues including closing on the strategic<br/>funding partner(s) for a two orders-of-magnitude scale-up as compared to the existing CBS plant or a<br/>5.000 metric ton per annum name-plate export module as well as to develop specific business cases, together<br/>with commercial partners, for the sale of the HydrofactionTM Oil, including: a low-sulfur diesel fuel for the<br/>marine sector or as a renewable fuel oil for co-processing in petroleum refineries for the production of diesel or<br/>jet fuels. The project also aims to identify and mitigate risks associated with technical, economical and financial<br/>aspects of commercialization and is executed to be executed over a two year timeframe starting from April<br/>2015.<br/>Financing<br/>The Company and its independent sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited have since 2012 obtained<br/>initial funding in the form of convertible loans from a Canadian private equity group. In 2014 this group has<br/>given additional loans so that by 31 December 2014 the total funding including accrued interest amounts to<br/>CAD 4,187k. Of this, CAD 2,689k has been borrowed by Steeper Energy ApS, with the remainder utilized by<br/>the Steeper Energy Canada Ltd. The two entities are jointly and severally liable for the total loan capital. It is<br/>expected that the loan will be converted into to equity midway through 2015.<br/>Intellectual Property Rights â Patenting<br/>As a technology-based enterprise the Company finds it critical to protect critical elements of its technology and<br/>knowledge through patenting. At the beginning of the year the Company had 46 active patent applications<br/>divided into 12 patent families. Two patent families were continued as international PCT applications in 2014.<br/>In addition, a new priority application was filed and one was discontinued. Thus, by the end of 2014, the Company<br/>had 46 patent applications in 12 patent families.<br/>Commercialization<br/>The operation of the CBS plant over the past 24 months and the quality of the Hydrofactionâ¢ oil that is produced<br/>has attracted interest from a large number of multinational companies who are investigating opportunities<br/>to enter the development and provision of Advanced Biofuels (second generation biofuels). These companies have a common opportunity: declining markets for their primary products and a desire to monetize excess<br/>low-value or waste resources such as forestry residuals, timber processing wastes, pulp & paper co-products,<br/>agricultural residues or energy crops. Many of these companies have visited the plant, and the company has an<br/>ongoing dialogue with a number of these resource owners and energy organizations. As a direct result a paid 3-<br/>month test campaign and funded a third party engineering study for a 2000 bpd or 100.000 fuel tonne export<br/>plant that was completed in 2014.<br/>Steeper Energy and its Canadian sister company Steeper Energy Canada Limited, has more than a dozen commercial<br/>projects in Europe and Canada identified and in the early phases of the project development. The critical<br/>step for market acceptance of Hydrofactionâ¢, and thus its commercialization, is the establishment of a<br/>project of an industrial-scale demonstration project The objective of the industrial scale demonstration project<br/>is to demonstrate technological and operational protocols at or near commercial-scale and substantially reduce<br/>risks associated with scaling up to 2.000+ bpd commercial-scale projects and thereby, pave the way for thirdparty<br/>investment and financing for future projects utilizing the Companyâs Hydrofactionâ¢ technology platform.<br/>In the light of the significant milestones achieved and the Companyâs positioning for the future the result of the<br/>activities in 2014 is considered to be excellent.<br/>Subsequent events<br/>The Companyâs first patent application âCoreâ was issued in the first jurisdiction (Canada) in April 2015.<br/>No other events materially affecting the assessment of the Annual Report have occurred after the balance sheet<br/>date.",Peter Thor Kellmer,Steen Brummerstedt Iversen,Beierholm Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,STEEPER ENERGY ApS,"In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company at<br/>31 December 2014 and of the results of the Company operations for the financial year 1 January â 31 December<br/>2014 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.",Rudersdal,2013-01-01,2013-12-31,-685102.0,Rudersdal,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,true,false,2015-04-30,Aalborg,"The Executive Board has today considered and adopted the Annual Report of Steeper Energy ApS for the financial<br/>year 1 January â 31 December 2014.<br/>The Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2014<br/>of the Company and of the results of the Company operations for 2014.<br/>In our opinion, Managementâs Review includes a true and fair account of the matters addressed in the Review.<br/>We recommend that the Annual Report be adopted at the Annual General Meeting.","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit.
