Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are also recognised in the income statement. Costs incurred to generate the earnings for the year are also recognised in the income statement, including amortisation, depreciation, impairment losses and provisions as well as reversals resulting from changed accounting estimates of amounts previously recognised in the income statement.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future financial benefits will flow to the Company and it is possible to obtain a reliable measurement of the individual assets.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future financial benefits will flow from the Company and it is possible to obtain a reliable measurement of the individual liabilities.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>On initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost, whereby a constant effective interest rate is recognised over the life of the individual asset or liability. Amortised cost is determined as original cost less any repayments and with the addition/deduction of the accumulated amortisation of the difference between cost and nominal amount.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Anticipated losses and risks arising before the presentation of the financial statements and confirming or disconfirming facts and circumstances known at the reporting date are taken into consideration at recognition and measurement.","Administrative expenses<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Administrative expenses include expenses for Management and administrative staff, office expenses, amortisation and depreciation, etc.",BALANCE SHEET,"Staff costs<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Staff costs include wages, salaries and other pay-related costs, such as sickness benefits for enterprise employees less wage/salary reimbursement from the Government.","Other external expenses include costs for sales, advertising, administration, premises, bad debts, rental expenses under operating leases, etc.","INCOME STATEMENT<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Gross profit is a combination of the items of 'Revenue', 'Change in inventories of finished goods, work in progress and goods for resale', 'Other operating income', 'Cost of raw materials and consumables' and 'Other external costs'.","Biological assets, sales reserves<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>","Payables<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Financial liabilities are recognised initially at the proceeds received net of transaction expenses incurred. In subsequent periods, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest method, so that the difference between proceeds and nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the life of the financial instrument(s).<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Other payables, comprising trade payables and amounts owed to Group enterprises and associates and other accounts payable, are measured at amortised cost, which normally corresponds to the nominal value.","Property, plant and equipment<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost on initial recognition and subsequently at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>The depreciable amount is calculated taking into consideration the residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life, reduced by impairment losses, if any. The depreciation period and the residual value are determined at the date of acquisition. If the residual value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, depreciation is discontinued.In case of changes in depreciation period or residual value, the effect of a change in depreciation period is recognised prospectively in accounting estimates.Cost includes the purchase price and expenses directly related to the acquisition until the time when the asset is ready for use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes costs for materials, components, subcontractors, direct payroll costs and indirect production costs.The cost of a composite asset is disaggregated into components, which are separately depreciated if the useful lives of the individual components differ.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the individual assets and their residual values:<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>User timeResidual valuePropertiesx yearsx %Plant and machineryx-x yearsx-x %Tools and equipmentx-x yearsx-x %Leasehold improvementsx-x years  x-x %<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/><br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/><br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>","Receivables are measured at amortised cost, which normally corresponds to the nominal value.

In cases where the tax base can be determined under alternative taxation rules, such as in relation to shares, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the intended use of the asset or settlement of the liability.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax losses allowed for carryforward, are measured at their anticipated net realisable value, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by offsetting against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. Any deferred net tax assets are measured at their net realisable values.<br xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and tax rates applicable when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax according to the legislation in force at the reporting date.
