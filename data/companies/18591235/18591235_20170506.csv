Consequently, we<br/>assess the attractiveness and the longterm<br/>performance of the investment as<br/>well as addressing all material risks.<br/><br/>Engaging actively<br/>As a responsible long-term oriented owner<br/>and investor, we engage actively with our<br/>companies and investment partners.
