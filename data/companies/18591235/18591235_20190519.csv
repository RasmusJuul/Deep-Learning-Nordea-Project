The<br/>responses are used to identify needed<br/>actions in teams and at an organisational<br/>level. The KIRKBI results are also benchmarked<br/>towards Ennova Employee Index<br/>(EEI), Denmark.

The<br/>E-NPS is based on the results for the PULSE<br/>question; âI would recommend KIRKBI as<br/>an employer to other people.â Here, the<br/>KIRKBI score is 69% out of 100%, providing<br/>KIRKBI with an indicator that we have<br/>loyal, motivated and engaged people.<br/>The average score in EEI Denmark is 9%.<br/><br/>But in line with our spirit â we always strive<br/>to do better ensuring that KIRKBI is the<br/>best and most healthful workplace.<br/><br/>A healthy working life<br/>We want to make sure that KIRKBI has a<br/>safe and healthy mental and physical<br/>work environment.

The LEGO Foundation<br/>is working to change the hearts and<br/>minds of those who influence childrenâs<br/>lives, through programmes, research and<br/>advocacy, to make sure they embrace<br/>the transformative power of play.<br/><br/>As part of the ongoing commitment to<br/>giving children better opportunities to<br/>reach their full potential, the LEGO Group<br/>owner family has entrusted the LEGO<br/>Foundation with 25% ownership of the<br/>LEGO Group and it is primarily through this<br/>ownership the LEGO Foundation funds its<br/>activities.<br/><br/>In 2018, the LEGO Foundation announced<br/>its first humanitarian grant: USD 100 million<br/>to Sesame Workshop to ensure that<br/>young children affected by the Rohingya<br/>and Syrian crises have opportunities to<br/>learn through play and develop the skills<br/>needed for the future.<br/><br/>The LEGO Foundation reached more<br/>than 2.4 million children around the<br/>world in total in 2018, including children<br/>in vulnerable situations reached through<br/>LEGO Charity product donations. The<br/>total LEGO Foundation activities amounted<br/>to DKK 532 million in 2018 (2017: DKK 407<br/>milion).<br/><br/>Ole Kirk's Fond<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond is a charitable foundation<br/>and its purpose is to improve the quality<br/>of life of children and their families. A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families. In 2018, focus has been<br/>to prepare for the construction site, which<br/>will be initiated in 2020.<br/><br/>Donations amounted to DKK 133 million in<br/>2018 (2017: DKK 90 million).","Management is responsible for the<br/>preparation of consolidated financial<br/>statements and parent financial statements<br/>that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with International Financial<br/>Reporting Standards as adopted by<br/>the EU and additional requirements<br/>of the Danish Financial Statements<br/>Act, and for such internal control as<br/>Management determines is necessary to<br/>enable the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements and parent financial<br/>statements that are free from material<br/>misstatement, whether due to fraud or<br/>error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements, Management is responsible<br/>for assessing the Groupâs and the<br/>Parentâs ability to continue as a going<br/>concern, for disclosing, as applicable,<br/>matters related to going concern, and<br/>for using the going concern basis of<br/>accounting in preparing the consolidated<br/>financial statements and the parent<br/>financial statements unless Management<br/>either intends to liquidate the Group or<br/>the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","People diversity<br/>KIRKBI wants to have a diverse working<br/>environment.

The LEGO Foundation<br/>is working to change the hearts and<br/>minds of those who influence childrenâs<br/>lives, through programmes, research and<br/>advocacy, to make sure they embrace<br/>the transformative power of play.<br/><br/>As part of the ongoing commitment to<br/>giving children better opportunities to<br/>reach their full potential, the LEGO Group<br/>owner family has entrusted the LEGO<br/>Foundation with 25% ownership of the<br/>LEGO Group and it is primarily through this<br/>ownership the LEGO Foundation funds its<br/>activities.<br/><br/>In 2018, the LEGO Foundation announced<br/>its first humanitarian grant: USD 100 million<br/>to Sesame Workshop to ensure that<br/>young children affected by the Rohingya<br/>and Syrian crises have opportunities to<br/>learn through play and develop the skills<br/>needed for the future.<br/><br/>The LEGO Foundation reached more<br/>than 2.4 million children around the<br/>world in total in 2018, including children<br/>in vulnerable situations reached through<br/>LEGO Charity product donations. The<br/>total LEGO Foundation activities amounted<br/>to DKK 532 million in 2018 (2017: DKK 407<br/>milion).<br/><br/>Ole Kirk's Fond<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond is a charitable foundation<br/>and its purpose is to improve the quality<br/>of life of children and their families. A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families. In 2018, focus has been<br/>to prepare for the construction site, which<br/>will be initiated in 2020.<br/><br/>Donations amounted to DKK 133 million in<br/>2018 (2017: DKK 90 million).","Management is responsible for the<br/>preparation of consolidated financial<br/>statements and parent financial statements<br/>that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with International Financial<br/>Reporting Standards as adopted by<br/>the EU and additional requirements<br/>of the Danish Financial Statements<br/>Act, and for such internal control as<br/>Management determines is necessary to<br/>enable the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements and parent financial<br/>statements that are free from material<br/>misstatement, whether due to fraud or<br/>error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements, Management is responsible<br/>for assessing the Groupâs and the<br/>Parentâs ability to continue as a going<br/>concern, for disclosing, as applicable,<br/>matters related to going concern, and<br/>for using the going concern basis of<br/>accounting in preparing the consolidated<br/>financial statements and the parent<br/>financial statements unless Management<br/>either intends to liquidate the Group or<br/>the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","People diversity<br/>KIRKBI wants to have a diverse working<br/>environment.

A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families.

Moreover, to underpin the<br/>long-term orientation, we endeavor to<br/>engage actively with the companies<br/>and investment partners. KIRKBI seeks<br/>to contribute positively to the strategic<br/>direction and the management of<br/>material ESG-related risks in each<br/>of the companies and investment<br/>partners for the long term.

KIRKBI and the board are<br/>constantly working to ensure the right<br/>combination of competencies to support<br/>the further development of the KIRKBI<br/>Group.

A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects.

Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families. In 2018, focus has been<br/>to prepare for the construction site, which<br/>will be initiated in 2020.<br/><br/>Donations amounted to DKK 133 million in<br/>2018 (2017: DKK 90 million).","Management is responsible for the<br/>preparation of consolidated financial<br/>statements and parent financial statements<br/>that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with International Financial<br/>Reporting Standards as adopted by<br/>the EU and additional requirements<br/>of the Danish Financial Statements<br/>Act, and for such internal control as<br/>Management determines is necessary to<br/>enable the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements and parent financial<br/>statements that are free from material<br/>misstatement, whether due to fraud or<br/>error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements, Management is responsible<br/>for assessing the Groupâs and the<br/>Parentâs ability to continue as a going<br/>concern, for disclosing, as applicable,<br/>matters related to going concern, and<br/>for using the going concern basis of<br/>accounting in preparing the consolidated<br/>financial statements and the parent<br/>financial statements unless Management<br/>either intends to liquidate the Group or<br/>the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","People diversity<br/>KIRKBI wants to have a diverse working<br/>environment.

The<br/>total LEGO Foundation activities amounted<br/>to DKK 532 million in 2018 (2017: DKK 407<br/>milion).<br/><br/>Ole Kirk's Fond<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond is a charitable foundation<br/>and its purpose is to improve the quality<br/>of life of children and their families. A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families. In 2018, focus has been<br/>to prepare for the construction site, which<br/>will be initiated in 2020.<br/><br/>Donations amounted to DKK 133 million in<br/>2018 (2017: DKK 90 million).","Management is responsible for the<br/>preparation of consolidated financial<br/>statements and parent financial statements<br/>that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with International Financial<br/>Reporting Standards as adopted by<br/>the EU and additional requirements<br/>of the Danish Financial Statements<br/>Act, and for such internal control as<br/>Management determines is necessary to<br/>enable the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements and parent financial<br/>statements that are free from material<br/>misstatement, whether due to fraud or<br/>error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements, Management is responsible<br/>for assessing the Groupâs and the<br/>Parentâs ability to continue as a going<br/>concern, for disclosing, as applicable,<br/>matters related to going concern, and<br/>for using the going concern basis of<br/>accounting in preparing the consolidated<br/>financial statements and the parent<br/>financial statements unless Management<br/>either intends to liquidate the Group or<br/>the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","People diversity<br/>KIRKBI wants to have a diverse working<br/>environment.

The LEGO Foundation<br/>is working to change the hearts and<br/>minds of those who influence childrenâs<br/>lives, through programmes, research and<br/>advocacy, to make sure they embrace<br/>the transformative power of play.<br/><br/>As part of the ongoing commitment to<br/>giving children better opportunities to<br/>reach their full potential, the LEGO Group<br/>owner family has entrusted the LEGO<br/>Foundation with 25% ownership of the<br/>LEGO Group and it is primarily through this<br/>ownership the LEGO Foundation funds its<br/>activities.<br/><br/>In 2018, the LEGO Foundation announced<br/>its first humanitarian grant: USD 100 million<br/>to Sesame Workshop to ensure that<br/>young children affected by the Rohingya<br/>and Syrian crises have opportunities to<br/>learn through play and develop the skills<br/>needed for the future.<br/><br/>The LEGO Foundation reached more<br/>than 2.4 million children around the<br/>world in total in 2018, including children<br/>in vulnerable situations reached through<br/>LEGO Charity product donations. The<br/>total LEGO Foundation activities amounted<br/>to DKK 532 million in 2018 (2017: DKK 407<br/>milion).<br/><br/>Ole Kirk's Fond<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond is a charitable foundation<br/>and its purpose is to improve the quality<br/>of life of children and their families. A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families. In 2018, focus has been<br/>to prepare for the construction site, which<br/>will be initiated in 2020.<br/><br/>Donations amounted to DKK 133 million in<br/>2018 (2017: DKK 90 million).","Management is responsible for the<br/>preparation of consolidated financial<br/>statements and parent financial statements<br/>that give a true and fair view in<br/>accordance with International Financial<br/>Reporting Standards as adopted by<br/>the EU and additional requirements<br/>of the Danish Financial Statements<br/>Act, and for such internal control as<br/>Management determines is necessary to<br/>enable the preparation of consolidated<br/>financial statements and parent financial<br/>statements that are free from material<br/>misstatement, whether due to fraud or<br/>error.<br/><br/>In preparing the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements, Management is responsible<br/>for assessing the Groupâs and the<br/>Parentâs ability to continue as a going<br/>concern, for disclosing, as applicable,<br/>matters related to going concern, and<br/>for using the going concern basis of<br/>accounting in preparing the consolidated<br/>financial statements and the parent<br/>financial statements unless Management<br/>either intends to liquidate the Group or<br/>the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","People diversity<br/>KIRKBI wants to have a diverse working<br/>environment.

A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families.

A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented.

The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families.

The<br/>E-NPS is based on the results for the PULSE<br/>question; âI would recommend KIRKBI as<br/>an employer to other people.â Here, the<br/>KIRKBI score is 69% out of 100%, providing<br/>KIRKBI with an indicator that we have<br/>loyal, motivated and engaged people.<br/>The average score in EEI Denmark is 9%.<br/><br/>But in line with our spirit â we always strive<br/>to do better ensuring that KIRKBI is the<br/>best and most healthful workplace.<br/><br/>A healthy working life<br/>We want to make sure that KIRKBI has a<br/>safe and healthy mental and physical<br/>work environment. This includes focussing<br/>on our peopleâs wellbeing and ensuring<br/>that work life is well balanced with life<br/>after work.<br/><br/>Through KIRKBIâs Working Environment<br/>Committeeâs, whose objective is to ensure<br/>a focus on environmental, safety and<br/>health areas and to identify areas of<br/>improvement. Along with this committee,<br/>and offers like access to fitness facilities<br/>and social sports initiatives, health<br/>care specialists and healthy food at<br/>the canteens, KIRKBI wants to give all<br/>employees the best opportunities to take<br/>care of their physical and mental health.<br/><br/>In KIRKBIâs PULSE survey â our annual<br/>employee engagement survey â we also<br/>measure how employees find work-life<br/>balance, health and safety in KIRKBI, and<br/>we follow up if there are any actions that<br/>need to be taken.<br/><br/>""It is at the very heart of our companies to always<br/>strive to do better.

A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented. Today,<br/>Ole Kirkâs Fond has special focus on the<br/>social area, although the foundation<br/>also supports cultural, church-related,<br/>humanitarian and educational purposes.<br/><br/>In 2018, Ole Kirkâs Fond supported many<br/>projects with the aim of supporting<br/>children and their families with a breathing<br/>space in everyday life. The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature. These<br/>children are often socially excluded<br/>and do not come out as much as other<br/>children do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Ole Kirkâs Fond joined forces<br/>with the Capital Region of Denmark and<br/>Rigshospitalet in 2016 to build a new<br/>public hospital called âBÃ¸rneRigetâ that<br/>sets new standards for the treatment of<br/>children, adolescents, pregnant women<br/>and their families.

Moreover, to underpin the<br/>long-term orientation, we endeavor to<br/>engage actively with the companies<br/>and investment partners. KIRKBI seeks<br/>to contribute positively to the strategic<br/>direction and the management of<br/>material ESG-related risks in each<br/>of the companies and investment<br/>partners for the long term.

Moreover, to underpin the<br/>long-term orientation, we endeavor to<br/>engage actively with the companies<br/>and investment partners. KIRKBI seeks<br/>to contribute positively to the strategic<br/>direction and the management of<br/>material ESG-related risks in each<br/>of the companies and investment<br/>partners for the long term.

A<br/>caring approach and the right of all children<br/>to be children were key motivators<br/>for LEGO founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen. Ole<br/>Kirkâs Fond was established in his memory<br/>and to fulfil the values and the caring<br/>philosophy that he represented.

The initiative<br/>âNature Clubsâ by Save the Children in<br/>Denmark is one of those projects. The<br/>establishment of nature clubs around<br/>Denmark will give children in marginalised<br/>residential areas educational and social<br/>experiences in the nearby nature.

The risk of not<br/>detecting a material misstatement<br/>resulting from fraud is higher than for<br/>one resulting from error, as fraud may<br/>involve collusion, forgery, intentional<br/>omissions, misrepresentations, or the<br/>override of internal control.<br/>â¢ Obtain an understanding of internal<br/>control relevant to the audit in order<br/>to design audit procedures that are<br/>appropriate in the circumstances, but<br/>not for the purpose of expressing an<br/>opinion on the effectiveness of the<br/>Groupâs and the Parentâs internal control.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the appropriateness of<br/>accounting policies used and the<br/>reasonableness of accounting<br/>estimates and related disclosures made<br/>by Management.<br/>â¢ Conclude on the appropriateness<br/>of Managementâs use of the going<br/>concern basis of accounting in<br/>preparing the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements, and, based on the audit<br/>evidence obtained, whether a material<br/>uncertainty exists related to events or<br/>conditions that may cast significant<br/>doubt on the Groupâs and the Parentâs<br/>ability to continue as a going concern.<br/>If we conclude that a material<br/>uncertainty exists, we are required<br/>to draw attention in our auditorâs<br/>report to the related disclosures in the<br/>consolidated financial statements and<br/>the parent financial statements or, if<br/>such disclosures are inadequate, to<br/>modify our opinion. Our conclusions are<br/>based on the audit evidence obtained<br/>up to the date of our auditorâs report.<br/>However, future events or conditions<br/>may cause the Group and the Entity to<br/>cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>â¢ Evaluate the overall presentation,<br/>structure and content of the<br/>consolidated financial statements<br/>and the parent financial statements,<br/>including the disclosures in the notes,<br/>and whether the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent financial<br/>statements represent the underlying<br/>transactions and events in a manner<br/>that gives a true and fair view.<br/>â¢ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit<br/>evidence regarding the financial<br/>information of the entities or business<br/>activities within the Group to express an<br/>opinion on the consolidated financial<br/>statements.
