These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled. This as-sessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value, including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as non-financial cri-teria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the valua-tion risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has been con-cluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be written off or not and whether projects under construction, or completed projects ready for sale, should be written down to a lower net realisable value is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements and note 2.4 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>We have on sample basis obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project suc-cess and whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed Man-agementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs assessment of signifi-cant financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled. This as-sessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value, including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as non-financial cri-teria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the valua-tion risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has been con-cluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be written off or not and whether projects under construction, or completed projects ready for sale, should be written down to a lower net realisable value is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements and note 2.4 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>We have on sample basis obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project suc-cess and whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed Man-agementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs assessment of signifi-cant financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled. This as-sessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value, including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as non-financial cri-teria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the valua-tion risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has been con-cluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be written off or not and whether projects under construction, or completed projects ready for sale, should be written down to a lower net realisable value is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements and note 2.4 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>We have on sample basis obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project suc-cess and whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed Man-agementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs assessment of signifi-cant financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled. This as-sessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value, including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as non-financial cri-teria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the valua-tion risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has been con-cluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be written off or not and whether projects under construction, or completed projects ready for sale, should be written down to a lower net realisable value is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements and note 2.4 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>We have on sample basis obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project suc-cess and whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed Man-agementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs assessment of signifi-cant financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled.

We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled. This as-sessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value, including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as non-financial cri-teria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the valua-tion risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has been con-cluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be written off or not and whether projects under construction, or completed projects ready for sale, should be written down to a lower net realisable value is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements and note 2.4 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>We have on sample basis obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project suc-cess and whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed Man-agementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs assessment of signifi-cant financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these mat-ters.<br/><br/>RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SALE OF ENERGY FARMS<br/>Determining the point in time when the sale of energy farms should be recog-nised is key to the reported financial performance of European Energy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, sales contracts often comprise multiple performance obligations, variable consideration and different contract conditions that involve judgement when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised.<br/><br/>Due to the significance and complexity associated with the above, revenue recognition from sale of energy farms is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial state-ments and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>Through testing of contracts on a sample basis and by reviewing Managementâs IFRS 15 analysis, we have verified that:<br/><br/>â variable consideration is based on the most likely consideration that Euro-pean Energy is entitled to and that it is highly probable that a significant re-versal will not be made in subsequent periods<br/>â performance obligations in the sales contracts have been appropriately iden-tified and that the considerations have been fairly allocated in comparison with stand-alone selling prices<br/>â revenue related to the different performance obligations is recognised when all material risks and rewards as stipulated in the sales contracts have been passed to the buyer.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 1.1 in the consolidated financial statements and note 1.1 in the Parent Company financial statements and assessed if the notes are fairly presented.<br/><br/>VALUATION OF INVENTORY<br/>Inventory comprises development projects, projects under construction and completed projects ready for sale. Projects comprise both greenfield and pur-chased projects.<br/><br/>The valuation risk associated with development projects is considered high, es-pecially as to whether or not a project will be completed or cancelled. This as-sessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value, including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as non-financial cri-teria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the valua-tion risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has been con-cluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be written off or not and whether projects under construction, or completed projects ready for sale, should be written down to a lower net realisable value is considered a Key Audit Matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements and note 2.4 in the Parent Company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter<br/>We have on sample basis obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project suc-cess and whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed Man-agementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs assessment of signifi-cant financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one re-sulting from error as fraud may involve collu-sion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre-sentations or the override of internal control.<br/>â obtain an understanding of internal control rel-evant to the audit in order to design audit pro-cedures that are appropriate in the circum-stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group and the Parent Company's internal control.<br/>â evaluate the appropriateness of accounting pol-icies used and the reasonableness of account-ing estimates and related disclosures made by Management.<br/>â conclude on the appropriateness of Manage-ment's use of the going concern basis of ac-counting and, based on the audit evidence ob-tained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going con-cern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditorâs Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our con-clusions are based on the audit evidence ob-tained up to the date of our Auditor's Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>â evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transac-tions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/>â obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence re-garding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to ex-press an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direc-tion, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our au-dit opinion.<br/><br/>We communicate with those charged with govern-ance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in in-ternal control that we identify during our audit.<br/><br/>We also provide those charged with government with a statement that we have complied with rele-vant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.<br/><br/>From the matters communicated to those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the finan-cial statements of the current period and therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our Auditorâs Report unless law or regulation pre-cludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determined that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",A review of European Energyâs position on corporate social responsibility according to section 99a and section 99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act is available at European Energyâs website: https://www.europeanenergy.dk/en/financial-reports/,"Management is responsible for the preparation of fi-nancial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Report-ing Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control that Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.<br/><br/>In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group and the Par-ent Company's ability to continue as a going con-cern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","A disclosure of European Energyâs diversity policy, targets and current performance is available at Eu-ropean Energyâs website:<br/>https://www.europeanenergy.dk/en/financial-reports/","Management is responsible for the Management Re-view.<br/><br/>Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Review, and we do not ex-press any form of assurance conclusion thereon.<br/><br/>In connection with our audit of the financial state-ments, our responsibility is to read the Management Review and, in doing so, consider whether the Man-agement Review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materi-ally misstated.<br/><br/>Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management Review provides the in-formation required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/><br/>Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the Management Review is in accordance with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Fi-nancial Statement Act.
