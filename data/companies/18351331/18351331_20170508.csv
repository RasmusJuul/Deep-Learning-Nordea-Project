This<br/>assessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value,<br/>including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as<br/>non-financial criteria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the<br/>valuation risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has<br/>been concluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be<br/>written off or not and whether projects under construction or completed<br/>projects ready for sale should be written down to a lower net realisable<br/>value is considered a key audit matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial<br/>statements and note 2.4 in the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the key audit matter<br/><br/>We have obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of<br/>the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project success and<br/>whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be<br/>concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed<br/>Managementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs expectation<br/>of financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we<br/>have reviewed concluded sales agreements.

This<br/>assessment depends on financial criteria (estimated net realisable value,<br/>including estimate of return on invested capital requirements) as well as<br/>non-financial criteria (permits, financing, finding a buyer, etc.).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, the<br/>valuation risk is considered medium or low when a sales agreement has<br/>been concluded.<br/><br/>Managementâs assessment of whether development projects should be<br/>written off or not and whether projects under construction or completed<br/>projects ready for sale should be written down to a lower net realisable<br/>value is considered a key audit matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial<br/>statements and note 2.4 in the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the key audit matter<br/><br/>We have obtained an understanding of the risks and stage of completion of<br/>the individual projects, Managementâs expectation of project success and<br/>whether or not a sales agreement has been concluded or is expected to be<br/>concluded in the near future.<br/><br/>For material and high-risk projects under development, we have reviewed<br/>Managementâs valuation analysis and verified Managementâs expectation<br/>of financial and non-financial criteria (success expectation).<br/><br/>For projects under construction or completed projects ready for sale, we<br/>have reviewed concluded sales agreements. Where no sales agreements<br/>have been entered into, we have reviewed Managementâs valuation<br/>analysis.<br/><br/>We have read notes 1.0 and 2.4 in the consolidated financial statements<br/>and note 2.4 in the parent company financial statements and assessed<br/>their fair presentation.<br/><br/>Key audit matter<br/><br/>Financing<br/>Apart from individual non-recourse loans in European Energyâs<br/>subsidiaries, the Group is primarily financed through a EUR 45 million bond<br/>loan.<br/><br/>The bond loan requires the Group to comply with certain loan covenants,<br/>where especially maintaining an equity ratio of at least 25% is associated<br/>with risk.<br/><br/>Maintaining this bond loan is essential to the Groupâs capital resource<br/>position and continuing as a going concern and is thus considered a key<br/>audit matter.<br/><br/>Further reference is made to note 3.2 in the consolidated financial<br/>statements.<br/><br/>How our audit addressed the key audit matter<br/><br/>We have compared the bond loanâs covenants with audited values at 31<br/>December 2016 in order to verify whether the Group is in compliance<br/>therewith. We have also reviewed Managementâs quarterly covenant<br/>compliance reporting in 2016.<br/><br/>We have compared the bond loanâs covenants with the budget for 2017 in<br/>order to assess Managementâs expected compliance in 2017.<br/><br/>We have assessed the reasonableness of the budget for 2017 by<br/>comparing it with signed but not completed contracts, project pipeline and<br/>the recent financial track record of the Group.<br/><br/>We have read note 3.2 in the consolidated financial statements and<br/>assessed its fair presentation.",http://europeanenergy.dk/en/investor-relations/financial-information/,http://europeanenergy.dk/en/investor-relations/financial-information/,http://europeanenergy.dk/en/investor-relations/financial-information/,Jonny Thorsted Jonasson,Knud Erik Andersen,European Energy A/S,European Energy A/S,556000.0,"In our opinion, the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial<br/>statements give a true and fair view of the<br/>financial position of the Group and the Parent<br/>Company at 31 December 2016 and of the<br/>results of the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs<br/>operations as well as the cash flows for the<br/>financial year 1 January â 31 December 2016 in<br/>accordance with the International Financial<br/>Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the<br/>EU and further requirements in the Danish<br/>Financial Statements Act.<br/><br/>What we have audited<br/>European Energy consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial<br/>statements for the financial year 1 January â 31<br/>December 2016, which comprise income<br/>statement, statement of comprehensive income,<br/>balance sheet, statement of changes in equity<br/>and notes, including a summary of significant<br/>accounting policies, for both the Group and the<br/>Parent Company, as well as statements of cash<br/>flows.
