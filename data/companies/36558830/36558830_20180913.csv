The residual contributed capital is owned by the DLG group. The ultimate parent company is DCC plc, which is domiciled in Ireland.<br/>A decision has been made to the effect that the entire profit of the Company's subsidiaries is to be distributed as dividends to the parent company. Accordingly profit for the year is transferred to distributable reserves under equity.<br/>Through the subsidiaries the customers of the DCC Energi Denmark group may now profit from access to a nationwide network of petrol stations, sales and delivery of fuel and heating to private households and the Danish business sectors within transport, industry, service and agriculture and aviation fuel for Danish airports as well as fuel card solutions under the trademarks Shell and Euro Shell.<br/>Since the acquisition previous year of Dansk Fuels A/S, an extensive plan has been executed to ensure the integration of the activities in Dansk Fuels A/S with DCC Energi Danmark and DCC Energi Center and to realise identified and potential synergies.<br/>It is part of the Company's strategy to generate profitable growth and to secure its investments on the Danish energy market. This is executed with particular focus on the oil industry with risk diversification relative to market groups requiring energy and relative to seasonal fluctuations. <br/>The cooperative platform with DLG and the acquisition of Dansk Fuels have had the expected impact in terms of business growth, balancing of sales, distribution and earnings during the year and t significantly contributed to the ongoing realisation of the Company's strategic objective. By means of this strategy, it is DCC Holding Denmark A/S' objective to generate a profit for the Company's shareholders that exceeds the shareholders' demand for return on their investment. Moreover, it is the Company's strategy to pay dividend based on excess capital resources that are not dedicated for business development.<br/>Performance during the year <br/>The Company's income statement for 2017/18 shows a profit after tax of DKK 68.5 million, and equity at DKK 388.5 million in the Companyâs balance sheet total at 31 March 2018.<br/>The Company's results rely directly on the results of the fully owned subsidiaries.

Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each individual accounting item below.<br/>Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost, and thus, constant effective interest is recognised over the term. Amortised cost is calculated as original cost less payments and addition/deduction of the accumulated write-down of the difference between cost and nominal amount which allocates capital losses and capital gains over the term.<br/>At measurement and recognition, consideration is given to unpredictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the annual report confirming or disconfirming matters that existed at the balance sheet date. <br/>DKK is used as functional currency.

The expected dividend payment for the financial year is disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/>Liabilities<br/>Current liabilities are measured at amortised cost usually corresponding to the nominal value of the liability. <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred tax is recognised of all temporary differences between carrying value and tax value of assets and liabilities. <br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Where taxable value can be computed according to alternative taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on basis of the planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised; either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities. <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as offset.","Administrative expenses<br/>Administrative expenses comprise legal and accounting expenses as well as expenses for services performed by the subsidiary DCC Energi Center A/S. <br/>Income from equity investments in group entities<br/>Income from equity investments in group entities comprise the proportionate share of the individual subsidiaries' profit/loss after tax after full elimination of intra-group gains/losses.<br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>Financial income and expenses comprise interest income and expenses, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as surcharges and refunds under the on-account tax scheme.<br/>Corporation tax<br/>Tax for the year, which comprises current tax for the year and deferred tax for the year, is recognised in the income statement at the amount attributable to the profit/loss for the year.

Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each individual accounting item below.<br/>Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost, and thus, constant effective interest is recognised over the term. Amortised cost is calculated as original cost less payments and addition/deduction of the accumulated write-down of the difference between cost and nominal amount which allocates capital losses and capital gains over the term.<br/>At measurement and recognition, consideration is given to unpredictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the annual report confirming or disconfirming matters that existed at the balance sheet date. <br/>DKK is used as functional currency.
