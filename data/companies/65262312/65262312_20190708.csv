The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue. Accordingly, the Group is to recognise the<br/>most probable value of the variable consideration in revenue.<br/>â a number of contracts contains several performance obligations to which the transaction price is to be<br/>allocated.<br/>The Company has relied on the following transitional provisions:<br/>â IFRS 15 has been applied following the cumulative effect method with any cumulative effects<br/>recognised in equity as of 1 January 2018 and with no restatement of comparative figures.<br/>The monetary effect of relying on IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation made up DKK 2,115 thousand in<br/>2018 specified as follows:<br/>Group Parent Company<br/>DKK'000 2018 2017 2018 2017<br/>Effect on:<br/>Total assets 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Equity 2,115 0 0 0<br/>Apart from the above, the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial<br/>statements and the parent company financial statements are consistent with those of last year.<br/><br/>Change in accounting class<br/>The annual report of A.T.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue.

The fundamental principle in IFRS 15 is that the<br/>Company is to recognise revenue so it reflects goods or services provided to customers at the amounts to<br/>which the Company is expected to be entitled for the provision of these goods or services.<br/>The effect for the Company of using IFRS 15 as the basis of interpretation is that:<br/>â variable consideration from contracts on which the customer's price may vary if a number of conditions<br/>are complied with after performance of the contract is to be recognised as revenue if it is highly likely<br/>that changes in estimated variable consideration do not have the outcome that an important part of the<br/>amount is to be reversed and thereby will reduce revenue.
