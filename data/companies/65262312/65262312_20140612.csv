An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management's responsibility for the financial statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control that Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on the Management's review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the Management's review.
