In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td /><td>Retained earnings</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control that Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on the Management's review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the Management's review.
