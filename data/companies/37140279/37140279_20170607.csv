If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. <br/>â¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the note disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view. â¢<br/>We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.","Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. <br/><br/>In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","Management is responsible for the Management's review. <br/><br/>Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. <br/><br/>In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. <br/><br/>Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act. <br/><br/>Based on our procedures, we conclude that the Management's review is in accordance with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
