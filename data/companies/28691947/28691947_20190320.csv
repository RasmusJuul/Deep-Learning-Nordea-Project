Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,<br/>they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial<br/>statements.<br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we<br/>exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:<br/>- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or<br/>error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is<br/>sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement<br/>resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,<br/>intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.<br/>- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are<br/>appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the<br/>Company's internal control.<br/>- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and<br/>related disclosures made by Management.<br/>- Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing<br/>the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists<br/>related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going<br/>concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's<br/>report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify<br/>our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.<br/>However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the note<br/>disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a<br/>manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/>We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and<br/>timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we<br/>identify during our audit.","Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance<br/>with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to<br/>enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or<br/>error.<br/>In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue<br/>as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of<br/>accounting in preparing the financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to<br/>cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","Management is responsible for the Management's review.<br/>Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any form<br/>of assurance conclusion thereon.<br/>In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review<br/>and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the financial<br/>statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.<br/>Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required<br/>under the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/>Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the Management's review is in accordance with the<br/>financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial<br/>Statement Act.
