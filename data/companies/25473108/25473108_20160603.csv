The<br/>busines success builds on a number of strengths: high quality international brands, ability to deliver comprehensive<br/>service solutions, a way of management firmly anchored in internationally recognized principles and standards and<br/>talented and professional employees who can find innovative solutions. This combination gives the customers peace of<br/>mind, higher return on assets as well as time and resources to concentrate on their main activities and fulfil their<br/>ambitions.

The<br/>busines success builds on a number of strengths: high quality international brands, ability to deliver comprehensive<br/>service solutions, a way of management firmly anchored in internationally recognized principles and standards and<br/>talented and professional employees who can find innovative solutions.

The<br/>busines success builds on a number of strengths: high quality international brands, ability to deliver comprehensive<br/>service solutions, a way of management firmly anchored in internationally recognized principles and standards and<br/>talented and professional employees who can find innovative solutions.

The business is also influenced by single larger<br/>deliveries which vary year by year and as such are difficult to forecast.<br/>Faced with the arrival of record number of asylum seekers and shrinking levels of public sympathy, more and more<br/>countries are using their foreign aid budgets to foot the bill of feeding and housing newcomers and thus diverting funds<br/>from projects and activities in e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa. This will continue to negatively impact the core customers and<br/>improve only late 2016 or early 2017. Kjaer & Kjaer has reacted to those unexpected challenges by intitiating various<br/>initiatives to get aligned with the exected level of business activitity. 2015 has thus been a tough year with significant<br/>impact on our business but while this is of course unsatisfactory and dissapointing, it is more a reflection of the size of the<br/>market downturn than it is a measure of the operational performance of the business which was overall satisfying. The<br/>busines success builds on a number of strengths: high quality international brands, ability to deliver comprehensive<br/>service solutions, a way of management firmly anchored in internationally recognized principles and standards and<br/>talented and professional employees who can find innovative solutions. This combination gives the customers peace of<br/>mind, higher return on assets as well as time and resources to concentrate on their main activities and fulfil their<br/>ambitions.
