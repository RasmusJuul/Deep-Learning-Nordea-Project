Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date.

Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date.

Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment.<br/>Cash flows from financing activities comprise raising and instalment on long-term debt, receivables and payable to group companies and payment of dividend.<br/>Cash and cash

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date.

Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year.

Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting.

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer. Revenue is recognised net of VAT, duties and sales discounts and is measured at fair value of the consideration fixed.<br/><br/>Other operating income<br/>Other operating income comprise income of secondary nature as viewed in relation to the Company's primary activities, including material exeptional gains from the sale of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, subsidies, rental income, etc.<br/><br/>Cost of goods sold<br/>Cost of goods sold comprises direct and indirect costs incurred to earn revenue, including depreciation and maintenance of lease cars as well as realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on payables and transactions in foreign currencies.<br/><br/>Other external expenses<br/>Other external expenses comprise expenses for distribution, sale, marketing, administration, premises, bad debts, etc.<br/><br/>Staff costs<br/>Staff costs comprise salaries and wages as well as social security costs, pension contributions, etc for the Companyâs staff.<br/><br/>Depreciation and amortisation<br/>Depreciation of premises, plant and equipment with a limited useful life is carried out straight-line on the basis of the expected economic and technical lives of these assets which are generally determined as follows:<br/><br/>Years<br/>Other tools and equipment<br/>3-5<br/>Leasing assets<br/>2-5<br/><br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>These items comprise interest income and expenses as well as tax surcharge and repayment under the Danish Tax Prepayment Scheme.<br/><br/>Income taxes<br/>Tax for the year, which consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax, is recognised in the Profit and loss account by the portion attributable to the profit/loss for the year. In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment.<br/>Cash flows from financing activities comprise raising and instalment on long-term debt, receivables and payable to group companies and payment of dividend.<br/>Cash and cash

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer.

In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer. Revenue is recognised net of VAT, duties and sales discounts and is measured at fair value of the consideration fixed.<br/><br/>Other operating income<br/>Other operating income comprise income of secondary nature as viewed in relation to the Company's primary activities, including material exeptional gains from the sale of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, subsidies, rental income, etc.<br/><br/>Cost of goods sold<br/>Cost of goods sold comprises direct and indirect costs incurred to earn revenue, including depreciation and maintenance of lease cars as well as realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on payables and transactions in foreign currencies.<br/><br/>Other external expenses<br/>Other external expenses comprise expenses for distribution, sale, marketing, administration, premises, bad debts, etc.<br/><br/>Staff costs<br/>Staff costs comprise salaries and wages as well as social security costs, pension contributions, etc for the Companyâs staff.<br/><br/>Depreciation and amortisation<br/>Depreciation of premises, plant and equipment with a limited useful life is carried out straight-line on the basis of the expected economic and technical lives of these assets which are generally determined as follows:<br/><br/>Years<br/>Other tools and equipment<br/>3-5<br/>Leasing assets<br/>2-5<br/><br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>These items comprise interest income and expenses as well as tax surcharge and repayment under the Danish Tax Prepayment Scheme.<br/><br/>Income taxes<br/>Tax for the year, which consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax, is recognised in the Profit and loss account by the portion attributable to the profit/loss for the year. In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment.<br/>Cash flows from financing activities comprise raising and instalment on long-term debt, receivables and payable to group companies and payment of dividend.<br/>Cash and cash

Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is effected as described below for each item.<br/>Anticipated risks and losses that arise before the time of presentation of the annual report and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date are considered at recognition and measurement.<br/>Income is recognised in the Profit and loss account when earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable to this financial year. Value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/>On initial recognition foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies, that have not been settled at the balance sheet date, are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising between the rate at the transaction date and the rate at the payment date or the balance sheet date, are recognised in the income statement. Fixed assets purchased in foreign currencies are translated using historical rates. Accordingly inventories are measured at the ruling rate of exchange at date of purchase.<br/><br/>Derivative financial instruments<br/>On initial recognition in the balance sheet derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and subsequently at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised under other receivables or other payables.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging of a recognised asset or liability are recorded in the Profit and loss account together with changes in the value of the assets or the liabilities hedged.<br/>For derivative financial instruments not complying with the requirements for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognised instantly in the Profit and loss account as financial income or financial expenses.<br/>Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and complying with the requirements for hedging future transactions are entered in the balance sheet and recognised directly on the equity.<br/><br/>PROFIT AND LOSS<br/>Net turnover<br/><br/>Revenue from the sale of manufactured goods and goods for resale is recognised in the income statement when delivery is made and risk has passed to the buyer. Revenue is recognised net of VAT, duties and sales discounts and is measured at fair value of the consideration fixed.<br/><br/>Other operating income<br/>Other operating income comprise income of secondary nature as viewed in relation to the Company's primary activities, including material exeptional gains from the sale of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, subsidies, rental income, etc.<br/><br/>Cost of goods sold<br/>Cost of goods sold comprises direct and indirect costs incurred to earn revenue, including depreciation and maintenance of lease cars as well as realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on payables and transactions in foreign currencies.<br/><br/>Other external expenses<br/>Other external expenses comprise expenses for distribution, sale, marketing, administration, premises, bad debts, etc.<br/><br/>Staff costs<br/>Staff costs comprise salaries and wages as well as social security costs, pension contributions, etc for the Companyâs staff.<br/><br/>Depreciation and amortisation<br/>Depreciation of premises, plant and equipment with a limited useful life is carried out straight-line on the basis of the expected economic and technical lives of these assets which are generally determined as follows:<br/><br/>Years<br/>Other tools and equipment<br/>3-5<br/>Leasing assets<br/>2-5<br/><br/>Financial income and expenses<br/>These items comprise interest income and expenses as well as tax surcharge and repayment under the Danish Tax Prepayment Scheme.<br/><br/>Income taxes<br/>Tax for the year, which consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax, is recognised in the Profit and loss account by the portion attributable to the profit/loss for the year. In the event that items recognised directly on equity result in changes to the tax liabilities of the company, the impact of such changes is set off when the entry is made on the equity.<br/><br/>The current tax payable or receivable is recognised in the balance sheet, stated as tax calculated on this yearâs taxable income, adjusted for prepaid tax.<br/>Deferred tax is recognised and measured applying the liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax-based value of assets and liabilities. The tax value of the assets is calculated based on the planned use of each asset.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured based on the tax regulations and tax rates of the relevant countries that will be in effect, using the laws at the balance sheet date, when the deferred tax is estimated to be triggered as current tax. Changes in deferred tax resulting from changed tax rates are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of carrying forward tax losses, are recognised in the balance sheet at their estimated realisable value, either as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets.<br/><br/>The Company is jointly taxed with Parent and its Danish Group enterprises. The current Danish income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed Danish companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation with a refund concerning tax losses).<br/><br/>THE BALANCE SHEET<br/>Tangible fixed assets<br/>Fixed assets with limited service time are entered at cost price less depreciations. Financing cost are recognised in the income statement.<br/><br/>In the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the asset in question is written down.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/>Inventories consist of vehicles, motorcycles and spare parts, including vehicles on lease contracts.<br/>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and net realisable value. Financing costs are not included in cost.<br/>Vehicles on lease contracts are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and write-downs.<br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute sale.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost, usually equalling nominal value less provisions for bad debts.<br/><br/>Equity<br/>Dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the general meeting. The proposed dividends for the financial year are disclosed as a separate item under equity.<br/><br/>Financial liabilities<br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.<br/><br/>THE CASHFLOW STATEMENT<br/>The cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method and shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as well as the companyâs cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the financial year.<br/>Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the gross profit less other external and staff expenses adjusted for non-cash operating items, working capital changes and income taxes paid.<br/><br/>Cash flows from investment transactions comprises the purchase and sale of property,
