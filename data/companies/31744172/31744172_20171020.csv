Profits and losses are recognised in the Income Statement under depreciation.      <br/>      <br/>Inventories:      <br/>      <br/>Inventories are measured at cost on basis of ""first in - first out"" (FIFO) accounting. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, write-down is provided to the lower value.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>The cost of merchandise as well as raw materials and consumables is calculated at acquisition price with addition of transportation and similar costs.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes cost of raw materials, consumables, direct payroll cost and direct production cost.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>The net realisable value of inventories is stated at sales price less completion costs and costs incurred to execute the sale and is determined with due regard to marketability, obsolescence and development in expected sales price.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>Receivables:      <br/>      <br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost which usually equals nominal value.

In cases, e.g. in respect of shares in which the statement of the tax base can be made according to alternative taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively.      <br/>      <br/>Deferred tax assets including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are measured at the expected realisable value, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Any deferred net tax assets are measured at net realisable value.      <br/>      <br/>Liabilities:      <br/>      <br/>Liabilities concerning debts to suppliers and other debts are measured at amortised cost which usually corresponds to the nominal value.      <br/>      <br/>Conversion of foreign currency:      <br/>      <br/>Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates on the transaction date. Differences in exchange rates arising between the transaction date and the payment date are recognized in the income statement as financial income and expenses.       <br/>      <br/>Receivables, debt and other monetary items in foreign currency, which are not settled at the date of the balance sheet, are measured at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Costs of sales work and contracts are recognized in the income statement as incurred.      <br/>      <br/>Financial fixed assets:      <br/>      <br/>Financial fixed assets are measured on the balance sheet date at fair value.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>Cash:      <br/>      <br/>Cash equivalents consist of bank deposits. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value.      <br/>      <br/>LIABILITIES:      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>Tax payable and deferred tax:      <br/>      <br/>Current tax liabilities and current tax receivable are recognised in the balance sheet as tax calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on previous yearsâ taxable income and taxes paid on account/prepaid.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>Deferred tax is measured according to the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities.      <br/>      <br/>      <br/>Deferred tax is measured according to the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. In cases, e.g. in respect of shares in which the statement of the tax base can be made according to alternative taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively.      <br/>      <br/>Deferred tax assets including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are measured at the expected realisable value, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Any deferred net tax assets are measured at net realisable value.      <br/>      <br/>Liabilities:      <br/>      <br/>Liabilities concerning debts to suppliers and other debts are measured at amortised cost which usually corresponds to the nominal value.      <br/>      <br/>Conversion of foreign currency:      <br/>      <br/>Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates on the transaction date. Differences in exchange rates arising between the transaction date and the payment date are recognized in the income statement as financial income and expenses.       <br/>      <br/>Receivables, debt and other monetary items in foreign currency, which are not settled at the date of the balance sheet, are measured at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the time of the origin of the debt is recognized in the income statement under financial income and expenses.","Gross income:      <br/>      <br/>Gross income comprises the net turnover, changes in inventories of finished goods, other operating income and external costs.      <br/>      <br/>Revenue      <br/>      <br/>Revenue is recognised less VAT and taxes and with the deduction of any discounts granted in connection with the sale.      <br/>      <br/>Staff costs:      <br/>      <br/>Staff costs include salaries and wages including holiday allowances, pensions and other costs for social security etc. for staff members.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users of accounting information taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.       <br/>      <br/>      <br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorâs report.
