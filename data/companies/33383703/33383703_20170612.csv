Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered<br/>material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions<br/>of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.<br/><br/>As part of an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the additional requirements<br/>applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout<br/>the audit. We also:<br/><br/>Â· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud<br/>or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that<br/>is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material<br/>misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve<br/>collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.<br/>Â· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures<br/>that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness<br/>of the companyâs internal control.<br/>Â· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of ac-counting estimates<br/>and related disclosures made by management.<br/>Â· Conclude on the appropriateness of managementâs use of the going concern basis of ac-counting in<br/>preparing the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty<br/>exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the companyâs ability<br/>to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to<br/>draw attention in our auditorâs report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such<br/>disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence<br/>obtained up to the date of our auditorâs report. However, future events or conditions may cause the<br/>company to cease to continue as a going concern.<br/>Â· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures,<br/>and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a<br/>manner that gives a true and fair view.<br/><br/>We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and<br/>timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that<br/>we identify during our audit.","Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance<br/>with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary<br/>to enable the preparation of financial statements and that are free from material misstatement, whether due to<br/>fraud or error.<br/><br/>In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the companyâs ability to continue<br/>as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis<br/>of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless management either intends to liquidate the company<br/>or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.","Management is responsible for managementâs review.<br/><br/>Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover managementâs review, and we do not express any form<br/>of assurance conclusion thereon.<br/><br/>In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read managementâs review and,<br/>in doing so, consider whether managementâs review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or<br/>our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.<br/><br/>Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether managementâs review provides the information required<br/>under the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/><br/>Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that managementâs review is in accordance with the financial<br/>statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statement<br/>Acts. We did not identify any material misstatement of managementâs review.",false,Auditor's report on audited financial statements,urn:ofk:oid:24175480,indberetninger-20180424,2.5097342,33383703.0,,2018-03-29T08:09:09.676Z,2017-06-12T10:16:43.919Z,regnskab,0.0,,2016-12-31,2016-01-01,X17-AM-53-QC,2017-06-12T10:16:44.082Z,,,,,,1519689.0,1221498.0,160000.0,1221498.0,330280.0,1519689.0,11406.0,298191.0,298191.0,298191.0,1178003.0,1178003.0,170280.0,11406.0,6406.0,5000.0,,
