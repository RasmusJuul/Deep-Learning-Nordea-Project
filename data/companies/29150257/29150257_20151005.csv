This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Entity's preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.","Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",,75 53 00 00,chairman,RevisionspÃ¥tegning,,urn:ofk:oid:21490706,indberetninger-20180424,2.5097342,29150257.0,,2018-03-30T08:04:11.512Z,2015-10-05T13:15:46.546Z,regnskab,0.0,,2015-06-30,2014-07-01,X15-AH-30-AJ,2015-10-05T13:15:46.670Z,,,,,,,15000000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
