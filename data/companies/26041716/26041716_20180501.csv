These matters were addressed<br/>in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a<br/>whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. We do not<br/>provide a separate opinion on these matters.<br/><br/>Financing<br/><br/>At 31 December 2017, the Group's credit facilities required extension or refinancing no later<br/>than first quarter 2019. The Group's liquidity was stressed, and the Group was in breach of<br/>its credit facilities of EUR 24 million based on a cash flow covenant. A waiver was obtained<br/>after 31 December 2017. Hence, the credit facilities are presented as current liabilities in the<br/>balance sheet.<br/><br/>The Group's financing facilities have been considered a key audit matter due to the need for<br/>refinancing and the breach of covenant.<br/><br/>On 27 February 2018, the Group entered into a financing agreement with Proventus Capital<br/>Partners (Proventus) for a EUR 40m loan facility which, subject to customary conditions<br/>being satisfied, is to be used to refinance the existing facilities during 2018.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.7 regarding Management's assessment of the Group's ability to<br/>continue as a going concern and the description of interest and liquidity risks in note 4.5 to<br/>the consolidated financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/><br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>+We assessed whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may<br/>cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a<br/>going concern<br/><br/>+We evaluated Management's going concern assessment, including Management's<br/>projected cash flows and funding needs.<br/><br/>+We assessed whether the new financing agreement with Proventus, including the<br/>conditions that are required to be satisfied, will enable the Group to refinance its current<br/>credit facilities.<br/><br/>+We have read notes 1.7 and 4.5 to the consolidated financial statements and assessed<br/>whether the description of the going concern assumption and description of interest rate<br/>and liquidity risks have been fairly presented.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/><br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International Relocation<br/>Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the recoverable value<br/>is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based on Management's<br/>assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the Parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/><br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>+We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margin improvements and the applied discount<br/>rate.<br/><br/>+We have discussed with and challenged Management on their expectations of the future,<br/>including the Group's 2020 strategy.<br/><br/>+ The expected growth rates and margin improvements were tested by analysing the bridge<br/>between historical realised revenue growth and margins and Management's expectations<br/>of future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Management's cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned in<br/>order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes.

Hence, the credit facilities are presented as current liabilities in the<br/>balance sheet.<br/><br/>The Group's financing facilities have been considered a key audit matter due to the need for<br/>refinancing and the breach of covenant.<br/><br/>On 27 February 2018, the Group entered into a financing agreement with Proventus Capital<br/>Partners (Proventus) for a EUR 40m loan facility which, subject to customary conditions<br/>being satisfied, is to be used to refinance the existing facilities during 2018.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.7 regarding Management's assessment of the Group's ability to<br/>continue as a going concern and the description of interest and liquidity risks in note 4.5 to<br/>the consolidated financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/><br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>+We assessed whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may<br/>cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a<br/>going concern<br/><br/>+We evaluated Management's going concern assessment, including Management's<br/>projected cash flows and funding needs.<br/><br/>+We assessed whether the new financing agreement with Proventus, including the<br/>conditions that are required to be satisfied, will enable the Group to refinance its current<br/>credit facilities.<br/><br/>+We have read notes 1.7 and 4.5 to the consolidated financial statements and assessed<br/>whether the description of the going concern assumption and description of interest rate<br/>and liquidity risks have been fairly presented.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/><br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International Relocation<br/>Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the recoverable value<br/>is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based on Management's<br/>assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the Parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/><br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>+We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margin improvements and the applied discount<br/>rate.<br/><br/>+We have discussed with and challenged Management on their expectations of the future,<br/>including the Group's 2020 strategy.<br/><br/>+ The expected growth rates and margin improvements were tested by analysing the bridge<br/>between historical realised revenue growth and margins and Management's expectations<br/>of future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Management's cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable.
