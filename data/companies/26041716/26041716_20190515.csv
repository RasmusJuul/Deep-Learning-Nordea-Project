These<br/>matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the<br/>financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our<br/>opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management. The revenue recognition criteria<br/>varies between the individual business lines.<br/><br/>We have considered revenue recognition a key audit matter due to the large number of<br/>contracts and the complexity associated with the recognition of revenue in each of the<br/>different business lines.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have obtained an understanding of the different types of services provided by the<br/>Group and the related processes and internal controls, and assessed whether the<br/>Groupâs revenue recognition policy is in accordance with IFRS.<br/>++We have reviewed and evaluated Managementâs analysis of the impact of implementing<br/>IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts wih Customers.<br/>++We have tested the design and implementation of key controls associated with revenue<br/>recognition, in each of the significant subsidiaries in the Group.<br/>++We have analysed the recognised revenue and compared the revenue to our<br/>expectations significant deviations between the recognised revenue and our<br/>expectations have been investigated by making inquires of Management and obtaining<br/>appropriate audit evidence relevant to Managementâs responses.<br/>++We have on a sample basis selected sales contracts and assessed, based on the terms<br/>in the contracts, whether revenue has been recognised accurately and in accordance<br/>with the Companyâs accounting policies.<br/>++We have on a sample basis selected invoices and credit notes and journal entries in the<br/>period immediately prior to and after year-end, and assessed whether revenue has been<br/>recognised in the correct accounting period.<br/>++ In addition, we have assessed the related accounts receivables by analysing the<br/>development in days of sales outstanding, overdue balances and payments received<br/>subsequent to year-end.",https://investor.thesantafegroup.com/static-files/dc0a90c0-109b-4a86-862a-f7081acf3a1b,https://investor.thesantafegroup.com/static-files/b00c5a09-cc7c-45db-9bc0-363c5d0dd7af,"We draw attention to Note 1.7, 4.5 and 5.11 to the<br/>consolidated financial statements and Note 15 to the Parent<br/>Company financial statements, in which Management has<br/>described the Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs financial<br/>position, liquidity risk and financing arrangements agreed<br/>with the main lender.

As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes.

We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable.

We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

We do not provide a separate opinion on<br/>these matters.<br/><br/>Valuation of goodwill<br/>The audit of the recoverable amount (impairment test) of Interdean-International<br/>Relocation Group has been considered a key audit matter as the determination of the<br/>recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty, since it is based<br/>on Managementâs assumptions regarding expected future revenue growth and margin<br/>improvements.<br/><br/>Reference is made to note 1.6 (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and note<br/>3.1 (Intangible assets) to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 (Investment in<br/>subsidiaries) to the parent company financial statements.<br/><br/>HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER<br/>For the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:<br/><br/>++We have tested the key assumptions in Managementâs determination of the recoverable<br/>amount such as revenue growth rates and margins and the applied discount rate.<br/>++ The expected growth rates and margins were tested by analysing the bridge between<br/>historical realised revenue growth and margins and Managementâs expectations of<br/>future revenue and margins in order to assess whether Managementâs cash flow<br/>expectations were reasonable. As part of that test, we also tested whether budgets for<br/>the Interdean-International Relocation Group historically have been realised as planned<br/>in order to assess the accuracy in the Companyâs forecasting processes. Growth<br/>rates were compared to market data to assess if the revenue growth expectations are<br/>reasonable. In addition we have discussed with and challenged Management on their<br/>future expectations.<br/>++ In respect of the discount rates, we used KPMGâs valuation specialists to assess<br/>whether the discount rates used by Management were reasonable and reflect market<br/>assessments.<br/>++ Based on the work performed, we have made an overall assessment as to whether the<br/>key assumptions applied are reasonable.<br/>++We have read notes 1.6 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements and note 11 to<br/>the parent company financial statements and assessed whether the description of the<br/>impairment test, including key assumptions and uncertainties have been fairly presented<br/>and in accordance with the requirements in IAS 36, Impairment of assets.<br/><br/>Revenue recognition<br/>The Group operates globally with revenue consisting of a large number of contracts with<br/>both companies and individuals.<br/><br/>The Groupâs revenue streams are divided into the following business lines; Moving<br/>Services, Relocation Services and Records Management.

The risk<br/>of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from<br/>fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud<br/>may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,<br/>misrepresentations or the override of internal control.<br/>++ obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to<br/>the audit in order to design audit procedures that are<br/>appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose<br/>of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the<br/>Groupâs and the Parent Companyâs internal control.<br/>++ evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used<br/>and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and<br/>related disclosures made by Management.<br/>++ conclude on the appropriateness of Managementâs use<br/>of the going concern basis of accounting and, based<br/>on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material<br/>uncertainty exists related to events or conditions<br/>that may cast significant doubt on the Groupâs and<br/>the Parent Companyâs ability to continue as a going<br/>concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty<br/>exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorâs<br/>report to the related disclosures in the financial<br/>statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to<br/>modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the<br/>audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorâs<br/>report. However, future events or conditions may cause<br/>the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue<br/>as a going concern.<br/>++ evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents<br/>of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and<br/>whether the financial statements represent the underlying<br/>transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and<br/>fair view.<br/>++ obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding<br/>the financial information of the entities or business<br/>activities within the Group to express an opinion on the<br/>consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for<br/>the direction, supervision and performance of the group<br/>audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.<br/><br/>We communicate with those charged with governance<br/>regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and<br/>timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including<br/>any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify<br/>during our audit.<br/><br/>We also provide those charged with government with a<br/>statement that we have complied with relevant ethical<br/>requirements regarding independence, and communicate<br/>to them all relationships and other matters that may<br/>reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and<br/>where applicable, related safeguards.<br/><br/>From the matters communicated to those charged with<br/>governance, we determine those matters that were of most<br/>significance in the audit of the financial statements of the<br/>current period and therefore the key audit matters. We<br/>describe these matters in our auditorâs report unless law<br/>or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter<br/>or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determined<br/>that a matter should not be communicated in our report<br/>because the adverse consequences of doing so would<br/>reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest<br/>benefits of such communication.","Santa Fe Group makes continuous efforts<br/>to improve its sustainability performance<br/>according to Santa Feâs Corporate CSR<br/>policy and its commitment to the UN Global<br/>Compact principles.<br/><br/>Santa Fe focuses on embedding sustainability into its business<br/>activities to mutual benefit for customers, business partners and<br/>other key stakeholders while concurrently ensuring that the Santa<br/>Fe Group exploit opportunities related to sustainability.<br/><br/>Santa Fe Groupâs objectives, activities, achievements and<br/>expectations within sustainability are detailed in its Global Compact<br/>Communication on Progress Report 2018, which is available at:<br/>https://investor.thesantafegroup.com/static-files/b00c5a09-cc7c-<br/>45db-9bc0-363c5d0dd7af in compliance with sections 99a and<br/>99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.<br/><br/>Governance structure<br/>CSR is an integral part of daily business operations and decision<br/>making in the Santa Fe Group.
