In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that give  a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.","Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.","Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the management commentary. We have not performed any further procedures in addition to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statement.On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in the management commentary is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and parent financial statement.",,4536102030.0,4532460800.0,Chief Executive Officer,Chairman,RevisionspÃ¥tegning,,urn:ofk:oid:5402898,indberetninger-20180424,2.5124327999999996,32444202.0,,2018-03-30T08:59:23.864Z,2015-06-01T15:28:07.651Z,regnskab,0.0,,2014-12-31,2014-01-01,X15-AC-85-RU,2015-06-01T15:28:07.703Z,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
