The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.

The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications.

Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty.

These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company recognizes revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company's revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services. Determining the stand-alone selling price (""SSP"") and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are determined based on the Company's best estimates with respect to these arrangements. For bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their individual SSP. The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. If an SSP is not directly observable, then the Company will estimate the SSP considering marketing conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's linear accelerators are generally sold in a bundled arrangement with hardware and software accessory products that enhance efficiency and enable delivery of advanced radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments; however, certain products are infrequently sold on a stand-alone basis. The majority of machine and software sales include installation services, training, warranty, and support services. Delivery of different performance obligations in a revenue arrangement often span more than one reporting period. For example, a linear accelerator and software may be delivered in one reporting period, but the related installation of those products may be completed in a later period. Hardware and software extended maintenance and service contracts are occasionally sold during the initial product sale, but the majority are sold separately near or at the end of the initial warranty period. Revenues related to extended warranty and service contracts are earned after the expiration of the initial warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms are generally commensurate with a significant milestone, such as contract signing, shipment, delivery, acceptance or service commencement.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Hardware products may include software that the hardware is dependent on and highly interrelated with and cannot operate without. The Company typically has a standard base configuration for its hardware products, but there are typically multiple options and configuration choices. Revenues from the sale of hardware are recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer. Product installation includes uncrating, moving the machine to the treatment room, connection and validating configuration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In addition, a number of testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to the contracted specifications. The Company recognizes revenues for hardware installation over time as the customer receives and consumes benefits provided as the Company performs the installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Software products include information management, treatment planning, image processing, clinical knowledge exchange, patient care management, decision-making support, and practice management software. Software installation includes transferring software to the customerâs computers, configuration of the software and potentially data migration. The Company recognizes revenues for on-premise software and software installation upon the customer's acceptance of the software and installation services.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Service revenues include revenues from initial and extended software support agreements, extended hardware warranty agreements, training, paid service arrangements when a customer does not have an extended warranty and parts that are sold by the service department. Revenues from hardware and software support agreements are accounted for ratably over the term of the agreement. Services and training revenues are recognized in the period the services and training are performed. Revenues for sales of parts are recognized when the parts are delivered to the customer and control is transferred.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Company's sale of hardware includes a one-year warranty. The Company uses the cost accrual method to account for assurance-type warranties. The standard warranty provision further includes services in addition to an assurance-type warranty (for example, preventative maintenance inspections, help desk support, and when and if available operating system upgrades). These service-type warranty features are recorded as a separate performance obligation and recognized ratably over the oneyear warranty period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue collected on behalf of a principal is not recognised as revenue. Instead the commission which the Company receives from the principal is recognised and there is no gross presentation of the full selling price and the related costs of sales.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax on all temporary differences.
