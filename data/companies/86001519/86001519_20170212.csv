That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go.

Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As an international Group, JYSK Holding A/S (âThe Groupâ) is in contact with thousands of customers, employees and business partners as well as other stakeholders every day. That requires commitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a continuous process where new areas and methods constantly develop. Our goal is always to be up to date with the development and, therefore, dialogue and cooperation with different stakeholders are very important. We consider the dialogue with our surroundings a part of the learning process and essential to obtaining a better understanding of the complex challenges we face as a global company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The improvement of social and environmental conditions is an ongoing process, and we believe that cooperation, dialogue and commitment are the way to go. Due to the complexity of the CSR work, it is difficult to guarantee that we always choose the right solutions and business partners.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In these Financial Statements we report on five overall themes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management has assessed that the Group achieves a better effect from memberships of and commitment to the organisations BSCI, FSC, DIEH (JYSK A/S) and Save the Children rather than laying down our own human rights policy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">This report is the Companyâs report in accordance with sections 99(a) and 99(b) of the Danish Financial Statements Act.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">2. Environment and climate</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As a global Group, we work on minimising the negative environmental impact of the production of the products that we sell. We are therefore working on some specific initiatives such as replacement of lights, more sustainable wood in the production and optimisation of warehouse facilities for the purpose of reducing the negative environmental impact.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Sustainable wood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Wooden furniture represents a large part of our product range, and forest clearing and illegal wood trade are real threats to the environment in many regions. As a material part of JYSKâs product range includes wood, we have an obligation to ensure that the wood we use originates from a sustainable source. We therefore give priority to our efforts to increase the share of sustainable wood in our product range as we feel that we are able to make a difference in this area.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the FSCÂ®/â¢, which stands for Forest Stewardship Council. In an FSC-labelled forest, the number of trees cut down does not exceed the number of trees produced by the forest, and, consequently, consideration is shown to the local population and animal and plant lives in the forest in question. At the same time, the label ensures that the people working in FSC-certified forests are trained, receive the required safety gear and a decent pay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">All wooden garden furniture purchased for JYSKâs stores in the financial period is produced from FSC-certified wood, and 60% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was FSC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">PEFC</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is not always possible to obtain FSC-certified wood for the production of goods for JYSK. Consequently, wood certified under other systems is also used such as PEFC-certified wood (Programme of the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), which guarantees that the wood used originates from sustainable forestry like the FSC label. The PEFC label is found on several of JYSKâs indoor wood furniture ranges.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By requiring that our suppliers and business partners use FSC- and PEFC-certified wood in their production, we contribute to ensuring that our products come from sustainable areas. 20% of our board-based furniture (measured in total number of items) purchased in the financial period was PEFC-certified.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our long-term target is for all products to be FSC-certified, which is a process we will continue in the financial period 2016/17.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Energy reduction and optimisation</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By optimising and enhancing our energy efficiency, we will be able to reduce our total energy consumption and CO2 emission.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">LED lighting</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on replacing all lighting in our stores by LED. LED bulbs are both cost- and energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than ordinary lighting. The electricity savings of LED bulbs reach about 80% compared to traditional light sources. At JYSK, all new stores will be fitted with LED. This also applies when existing stores are relocated to other buildings.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has installed LED lighting in more than 50% of the stores and in more than 90% of the stores in Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. JYSKâs target is to install LED lighting in additionally 200 stores in the financial period 2016/17. The replacement is an ongoing process, and the long-term target is for all stores to be fitted with LED lighting.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Warehouse facilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Throughout the past couple of years, we have focused on investing in new automated distribution centres, which means that, among other things, considerably less energy is used for heating as the automated distribution centres consist of high-bay stores which are only heated to five degrees centigrade.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, The Group expanded its distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ in Sweden by 75,000 new pallet places in new unheated high-bay stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In continuation of this, the existing lighting in the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ has been replaced by LED lighting in the same period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Transport</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Every day, we transport thousands of goods from the suppliers to the distribution centres and from the distribution centres to the stores. This requires much transport, which adds to our CO2 emission. We want to reduce this emission and have therefore taken a number of initiatives in this respect.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We are working on eg packing the goods more efficiently on the pallets before they are dispatched from the distribution centres to the stores. In this respect, we use e-learning to train our employee in packing the goods as efficiently as possible, and a number of technical tools are made available for the same purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the period, the distribution centre in Radomsko in Poland increased its m3 per loading metre by 5.5%. This means that there are 5.5% more m3 goods per loading metre in the lorries. Ultimately, this means that fewer lorries are driving from the warehouses to the stores, which saves CO2.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In connection with the expansion of the distribution centre in NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, new high-bay stores will be put into operation on a current basis, which will in the long term imply a reduction of transports from remote warehouses. The number of remote warehouses and the quantities stored there will be reduced during this period. The process will continue going forward, and the target for the financial period 2016/17 is that only one remote warehouse is used. This will ensure a considerable reduction of the total emission of CO2 in connection with transport between company warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the next two years, JYSKâs Code of Conduct will be rolled out to all of JYSKâs carriers in connection with contract negotiations. This Code of Conduct will contribute to ensuring that the carriers meet JYSKâs requirements within human rights and the environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Waste handling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Goods are currently transported from our distribution centres to our stores. This generates a large amount of waste from packaging such as eg cardboard, plastic, wood and metal, a large part of which cannot be utilised optimally. Therefore, during the financial period 2015/16, initial initiatives have been taken in respect of a comprehensive project, the purpose of which is to improve waste handling in The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The initiative involves all parts of The Group as well as the part of ApS af 19/12 2014 which relates to the operation of JYSK in Denmark, Holland and the UK. During the financial period, a total amount of approx EUR 2.5 million was spent on transport of used packaging and waste-related direct and indirect taxes. Our long-term target is to reduce this amount to nil over a three-year period. The first subsidiary goal of the process is to reduce the amount by EUR 500,000 in the financial period 2016/17. To JYSK this involves eg thorough sorting of the materials that are recyclable. It is moreover important to ensure that the materials are in good condition as it would affect both quality and the value of the recycle materials if they eg get wet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">By enhancing the efficiency of and optimising waste handling in the Company, we ensure that an increasing amount of waste is recycled rather than lost. Because of the initiative, there will also be fewer lorries on the roads transporting materials to and from distribution centres and stores. The initiative is therefore not only a mere cost-efficient solution, but is also a responsible and sustainable method for waste handling.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">3. Supplier management</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Group has hundreds of suppliers globally. Teamwork with our suppliers is a fundamental element in our business, and this is thus an area where we can make the biggest difference with respect to eg the environment, human rights and animal welfare. At JYSK, we take responsibility, and we expect and demand that our suppliers do the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Together with ApS 31/8 1984, The Group joined BSCI in 2006 as one of the first Danish companies. The Group and ApS 31/8 1984 share a joint membership as a large number of our suppliers are the same.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The BSCI is an international inspection and training system for suppliers. As members, companies agree to follow a shared Code of Conduct, which is a joint code containing 11 principles for running an ethical and socially responsible business. The principles are based on international conventions and, among other things, prohibit child labour, forced labour, corruption and discrimination, and set out requirements for safety, working hours and environmental protection.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Learn more about the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct (http://www.bsci-intl.org/content/bsci-code-conduct).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The 11 principles constitute the foundation of our Code of Conduct which JYSKâs suppliers must sign. By signing, JYSKâs suppliers commit to complying with the specific requirements and standards described. Through BSCI, we can check our suppliers and their production processes thus ensuring compliance with our Code of Conduct. We moreover offer our suppliers the opportunity to receive training in the 11 principles of the BSCI Code of Conduct and, not least, in the current issues faced in the countries in question.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important to us that our suppliers comply with our requirements. In this respect, we consider cooperation and involvement an important approach. Through involvement, we will contribute to influencing development in a positive direction. If we see a supplier making mistakes, our initial response will be to maintain the supplier and ensure that improvements are made rather than immediately terminate our cooperation. Therefore, we work systematically on improving the situation and processes in cooperation with our suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 639 audits were performed at the suppliers of The Group and ApS 31/8 1984, which corresponds to 60% of the total number of suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, JYSK participated in BSCI training and in the BSCI Annual Conference in Brussels. Based on this training, JYSK has visited selected suppliers to ensure quality and compliance with BSCI, and has at the same time trained and sparred with suppliers on BSCI-related matters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Animal welfare</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">A significant part of our business consists of sales of pillows and duvets filled with down and feathers from ducks and geese. We have 10 suppliers of down and feathers, and the fairly few suppliers compared to our large product range reflect our strong focus on ethics and quality.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We do not tolerate animal abuse of any kind. For the same reason, our suppliers bind themselves by contract to only supply down and feathers from slaughterhouses - ie from slaughtered fowl. Inspections, trade documents and supplier visits ensure that our suppliers do not purchase down and feathers plucked from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The debate about down and feathers plucked from live fowl has been on the agenda several times during the past couple of years. Many people consider it more of a rule rather than an exception for down and feathers to be plucked from live fowl. However, according to the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL) the reality is different as 99% of the down and feathers in the world are byproducts from the food industry and, therefore, originate from slaughtered fowl. Also, the process of plucking feathers from live fowl is substantially more expensive and, consequently, not profitable for the major part of companies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Nevertheless, JYSK has chosen to constantly monitor our suppliers of down and feathers, and during the financial period, three audits were performed in cooperation with IDFL of the Chinese suppliers. One audit is effective for one year at a time, and, therefore, the audits will be performed again in the financial period 2016/17. The audits did not give rise to any suspicion of the suppliers delivering down and feathers from live fowl.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We also take a stand in respect of animal skins. We only sell skins from animals which are secondary byproducts from the food industry. The skins originate from slaughtered animals â ie animals which would be slaughtered anyway. The animals are therefore not slaughtered only for their skin. Tanning of skins is carried out without any harmful substances.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">4. Partnerships</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The surrounding world affects our company, just as our company has an impact on the surroundings. Therefore, JYSK wants dialogue and cooperation as they provide the best basis for fulfilling our responsibilities and meeting the challenges which we face as a global group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danish Ethical Trading Initiative (DIEH)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of the DIEH. The DIEH is a Danish multi-stakeholder initiative for businesses, trade unions and popular organisations. The objective is to work jointly on ethical trade and find constructive solutions to the challenges faced by Danish enterprises in relation to suppliers in the developing countries and new growth economies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">During the financial period, JYSK has currently participated in meetings at the DIEH.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Save the Children</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has been a business partner to Save the Children since 2008, and the Company was the main sponsor of Save the Children in Denmark in 2015.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The object of the sponsorship is to make a difference for the children and young people who are worst off in Denmark and in the world by giving them better access to education and development. Together with IDdesign and others, JYSK donated two million Danish kroner over a period of two years for the Save the Childrenâs work in Denmark and the rest of the world. The donations are spent on eg construction of temporary schools where children can take an education and find safety and definite bounds in an otherwise chaotic life. In Denmark the donations are spent on eg increased efforts to prevent bullying and establish a community of children where there is room for all.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">FSC Denmark</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a member of and cooperates with FSC Denmark which, among other things, works for the positioning and dissemination of the FSC label in Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Danmarks Indsamling is a national fund raising event in aid of the developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America arranged by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and 12 of Denmarkâs largest humanitarian organisations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2016, the theme for the fund raising was â10 years against povertyâ focusing on the poverty faced every day by some 800 million people in the world. Almost DKK 98 million was raised which is distributed to specific projects. JYSK supports the fund raising with a large sum each year.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Danish Church Army organisation operates warm shelters, hostels and group homes to help vulnerable people in Denmark who for some reason have endured hardships in life. Close to 10,000 people visits the organisationâs many places and they include people with psychiatric disorders, abusers, homeless people or people with criminal records. They may also be people who are lonely, which is a common phenomenon today. People are welcomed by the organisation if they need a place to sleep, need a shower or an inexpensive meal, or if they just need to talk.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As sponsor, JYSK donates every year sleeping bags, mattresses and socks to the Danish Church Army for the benefit of its visitors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Disabled sports</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we have chosen our main sponsorship to be awarded to disabled sports. The considerations behind our support of this type of sports are caused by the admirable commitment of the athletes. They prove that you can do whatever you want to do, and the partnership is based on joint values.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The sponsorship started after the Seoul 1988 Paralympics when the Danish para-athletes needed a main sponsor. This also makes the agreement between JYSK and the Danish para-sports confederation (DHIF) to one of the longest-ever sports sponsorships in Denmark. The sponsorship agreement involves eg fundraising lotteries in the Danish JYSK stores and support to local sports clubs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In 2002, JYSK became the main sponsor of para-sports in Norway, and Sweden followed in 2004. In addition to that, JYSK is also sponsor for para-sports in Finland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia while JYSK Franchise supports in Canada, Iceland and on the Faroe Islands.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">5. Customers</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Consideration and thought for our customers and our surroundings is a cornerstones for us. Therefore, we naturally take responsibility for the products we sell.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Product safety and quality</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Besides tests and documentation from suppliers, we also test the products ourselves. We moreover use external testing firms and spot-checking on a current basis. In the financial period, external testing firms have performed 360 tests and inspections on behalf of The Group.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has prepared an annual wheel that gives an overview of the various product groups, which helps ensuring that all product groups are tested within a given period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has also prepared a model for quality checking which, among other things, comprises quality assurance, assembly days, quality check at reception at distribution centres and feedback from the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we had âassembly daysâ when in the spring of 2016 a test team of JYSK employees travelled to China to assemble and test furniture for the 2016 indoor season. The furniture was subsequently checked again in Poland. The purpose of these âassembly daysâ was to ensure that the furniture which is subsequently sold in the stores meets our quality requirements. These procedures were also applied to our outdoor furniture.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK made a video in the financial period describing our quality checking procedures.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Substances of very high concern (SVHC)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK currently focuses on reducing the use of substances with suspicious effects. Therefore, as from 1 January 2017, we do not allow any SVHC in any of our products.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The Oeko-Tex label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label ensures that the products are inspected for dangerous colouring agents and chemicals, and that the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 requirements have been met.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, we have continued our work of extending the range of products which may be Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 label is found on a large number of our products, among other things on 99% of our bed linen, sheets and towels. All textiles meet the requirements of the Oeko-Tex label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The CertiPUR Label</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The label is a voluntary standard to promote safety, health and environmental performance in flexible polyurethane foams used for, among other things, mattresses.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the financial period, 35.7% of the mattresses and top mattresses sold by JYSK were labelled with the CertiPUR Label.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">6. Employees</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we all have equal rights irrespective of gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs. In The Groupâ competence development, career paths and talent programmes, we present the possibilities offered by the Company to both genders.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Staff development</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, we focus strongly on internal recruitment when filling executive positions. As a natural extension of this focus, we offer many opportunities for professional development and career.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">With respect to increasing the representation of women at other executive levels, the Group did not give differential treatment to candidates because of their gender during the financial period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">As part of our internal career paths, JYSK works at all levels of the organisation under the performance management programme 'SIRIUS' to secure the internal pipeline. Under this programme, the performance of the individual employee is evaluated. The object of SIRIUS is to evaluate all employees - irrespective of their gender, race, political affiliation and religious beliefs - according to their ability to work under JYSKâs values which are JYSK VALUES and JYSK LEADERSHIP. Based on the work with SIRIUS, potential leaders are identified and selected for four development programmes at different levels.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the external recruitment process, The Group wants to continuously ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to be considered for an executive position. This is ensured through training of the employees responsible for the recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Diversity</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, we want our employees to represent the demographic distribution in society, including the distribution of men and women in the individual countries. We find this to be a clear advantage for both our employees and our customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Generally, there is a balanced gender representation in the total staff.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is, however, difficult to ensure a general balanced representation in all areas in the Company. At JYSK, we are of the opinion that during a recruitment process focus is first and foremost on qualifications - irrespective of the candidateâs gender. However, in areas where the difference is inappropriately large, it will be taken into account. In this case, it will be considered whether it would be beneficial to the employee group in question to increase the minority, be it by women or men. In general, the most important thing is, however, that we get the best candidate for the position.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At JYSK, the race, sexual orientation or religious beliefs of our employees are not important. Our clear conviction is that it does not affect an employeeâs ability to do his or her job.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK is a family-owned company which is also reflected on the Board of Directors with its six board members. Our target ratio is that at least 25% of the board members are women. This target has been achieved as the Board of Directors is membered by four men and two women.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Job satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Employee satisfaction</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At The Group, our employees and their views are important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We therefore perform employee satisfaction surveys as they help us understand where to take measures to improve satisfaction and loyalty. In our 2016 survey 96% of all JYSKâs national and international employees responded. The higher the response rate, the more correct view we will get of the opinion of our employees. A high response rate is also often a sign of the employees being willing to express their views and of their confidence in being able to do so without facing any consequences. This is in line with JYSKâs values that dictate a right and duty to raise oneâs voice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Our employees are asked to express their satisfaction and loyalty on a scale from 1 to 100 as shown below.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In respect of the employees in the stores, at the offices and the distribution centres, satisfaction reached an average rate of 78. Most employee groups expressed increasing satisfaction, especially at the distribution centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In this respect, attention should be called to particularly Romania with its average satisfaction rate of 88, China with its average rate of 85 and Bulgaria with its average rate of 83.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Loyalty reached an average rate of 79. In this respect, attention should be called to Romania with its average loyalty rate of 88, Serbia with its average rate of 84 and Poland with its average rate of 82.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">In the areas where the satisfaction or loyalty rates are declining, we are making an effort to improve the feedback given by our employees. This applies to eg job content in respect of which our employees indicated that they faced high pressure in some periods on eg Black Friday and in the Holiday Season when they would like to have more support.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Safety</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">It is important that the employees have a safe and healthy working environment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">At the distribution centres in Radomsko and NÃ¤ssjÃ¶ 6 and 11 work-related accidents were registered in the financial period 2015/16 resulting in the involved employeeâs/employeesâ absence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Overall, there is a target for the distribution centres to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 10% in the financial period 2016/17. This will be achieved eg through e-learning during the introductory period introducing the employee to the workplace and to safety at the distribution centre. The employees are trained in eg safe pallet handling and the way in which to pack the goods on the pallets to prevent them from tipping. JYSK also focuses on avoiding heavy lifts by investing in tools and new technology for both the distribution centres and the stores.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">JYSK has moreover implemented processes to analyse work-related accidents at the distribution centres for the purpose of preventing future accidents from occurring. There is furthermore focus on changing the attitude to correct, safe behaviour at the workplace.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
