Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described for each item below. <br/>Recognition and measurement take into account predictable losses and risks occurring before the presentation of the Annual Report which conï¬rm or invalidate affairs and conditions existing at the balance sheet date. <br/>The annual report is presented in USD in accordance with section 16(2) of the Danish Financial Statements Act. <br/> <br/>Translation policies <br/>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised. Moreover, all expenses incurred to achieve the earnings for the year are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company, and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. <br/>Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the Company, and the value of the liability can be measured reliably. <br/>Assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Furthermore, value adjustments of ï¬nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortised cost are recognised.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and subâsuppliers. <br/>Interest expenses on loans raised specifically to finance the manufacture of property, plant and equipment are recognised in cost over the manufacturing period. All indirectly attributable borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement. <br/>Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straightâline basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: <br/>Other ï¬xtures and ï¬ttings, tools and equipment 3-5 Years<br/> <br/>Assets costing less than USD 1,766 are expensed in the year of acquisition. <br/> <br/>Impairment of ï¬xed assets <br/>The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation.  <br/>If so, the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. <br/> <br/>Write-down of non-current assets <br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation. <br/>If this is the case, an impairment test is made in order to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and a write-down is made to this lower value. <br/>The recoverable amount for the asset concerned is made up as the higher of the net selling price and the net present value. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets are assessed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount. <br/>Assets for which no separate value in use can be determinable, as the asset does not in itself generate any future cash flows, are subject to review for impairment together with the group of assets to which they belong. <br/> <br/>Investments in subsidiaries and associates <br/>lnvestments in group enterprises are measured, using the equity method, at the parent's proportionate share of such enterprises' equity plus goodwill on consolidation and less intra-group profits and negative goodwill. Enterprises whose equity is negative are measured at zero, as the proportionate share corresponding to the negative value is set off against receivables, if any. Any additional amounts are recognised under 'Provisions' if the parent is liable for the debt. <br/> <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts <br/>Foreign exchange forward contracts are initially recognised at cost. The Company provides for losses in respect of outstanding contracts as at balance sheet date on marked to market basis. At the time of finalisation of contract, currency adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. <br/> <br/>Financial assets <br/>Fixed-interest loans, such as mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are recognised at the time of borrowing at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the term of the loan. <br/>Deposits comprises rent deposits, which are recognized and measured at cost price. There are no depreciation on deposits. <br/> <br/>Current assets <br/> <br/>Receivables <br/>Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable, and in respect of trade receivables, a general provision is also made based on the Companyâs experience from previous years. <br/>Exchange rate adjustments of long-term loans to group enterprises are taken to equity, as these loans are considered ""equity"" loans. <br/> <br/>Cash at hand and in bank <br/>Cash at hand and in bank comprise cash and short-term marketable securities which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. <br/> <br/>Equity and liability <br/> <br/>Dividend <br/>Dividend distribution proposed by Management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. <br/> <br/>Provisions <br/>Provisions are recognised when - in consequence of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic beneï¬ts must be given up to settle the obligation. <br/> <br/>Reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method <br/>The net revaluation reserve according to the equity method includes net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to cost. The reserve may be eliminated in case of Iosses, realisation of investments or a change in accounting estimates. The reserve cannot be recognised at a negative amount. <br/> <br/>Other financial liabilities <br/>Other financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the time of contracting the debt. Subsequently, it is stated at amortised cost, which in respect of shortâterm and nonâinterest Bearing debt and in respect of floating-rate loans usually corresponds to nominal value. <br/> <br/>Deferred tax assets and liabilities <br/>Deferred income tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ï¬nancial reporting purposes on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. <br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryâforwards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set- off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. <br/>Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement. <br/> <br/>Corporation tax receivables and liabilities <br/>Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on account. Extra payments and repayment under the on- account taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in ï¬nancial income and expenses. <br/> <br/>Other payables <br/>Other payables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to nominal value.","Revenue <br/>Revenue from the sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognised in the income statement when delivery and transfer of risk to the buyer have been made before year end. <br/>Revenue is recognised exclusive of VAT and net of discounts relating to sales. <br/>""A sale is considered completed when:<br/>â¢ delivery has taken place before the end of the financial year,<br/>â¢ a binding sales agreement has been entered into,<br/>â¢ the sales price has been determined, and payment has been received or it is reasonably certain that payment will be received."" <br/> <br/>Cost of sales <br/>Cost of sales comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation and administration.  <br/>Cost of sales also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisations well as amortisation of capitalised development costs. Finally, provisions for losses on contract work are recognised. <br/>Distribution expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales and distribution staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Amortisation of goodwill is also included to the extent that goodwill relates to distribution activities. <br/> <br/>Other external expenses <br/>Other external expenses comprise indirect production costs and expenses for premises, sales and distribution as well as office expenses, etc. <br/> <br/>Staff expenses <br/>Staff costs comprise wages and salaries as well as related costs. <br/> <br/>lncome from investments in group entities <br/>These include the parent's proportionate share of the profit or loss for the year and adjustment of intra-group gains/losses, and net of amortisation of goodwill on consolidation. <br/> <br/>Financial income and expenses <br/>Financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the ï¬nancial year. <br/>Financial income and financial expenses comprise interest, financial expenses on finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange rate adjustments as well as value adjustment of securities. <br/> <br/>Tax on proï¬t/loss for the year <br/>The parent company is covered by the Danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the Group's Danish subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation arrangement from the date at which they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date when they are excluded from the consolidation. <br/>The parent company is the management company for the joint taxation and consequently settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. <br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, the current Danish corporation tax charge is allocated between the jointly taxed enterprises in proportion to their taxable income. Enterprises with tax Iosses receive joint taxation contributions from enterprises that have been able to use the tax Iosses to reduce their own taxable income.  <br/>Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the proï¬t for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. <br/>Changes in deferred tax due to changes in the tax rate are recognised in the income statement.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditorâs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of this auditorâs report.
