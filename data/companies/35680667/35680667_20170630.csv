Patents are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining<br/>life of the patent, and licences are amortised over the contract period, however, not<br/>exceeding 7 years.<br/><br/>Property, plant and equipment<br/><br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment and leasehold improvements are measured<br/>at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.<br/><br/>Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition<br/>until the date on which the asset is available for use. Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the<br/>difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the<br/>date of disposal. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement as other<br/>operating income or other operating costs, respectively.<br/><br/>Impairment of fixed assets<br/><br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as<br/>equity investments in group entities is subject to an annual test for indications of<br/>impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation.<br/><br/>Impairment tests are conducted of individual assets or groups of assets when there is<br/>an indication that they may be impaired. Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost. If cost exceeds the net realisable<br/>value, write-down is made to this lower value.<br/><br/>Inventories<br/><br/>Goods for resale and raw materials and consumables are measured at cost,<br/>comprising purchase price plus delivery costs.<br/><br/>The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the sales amount less costs of<br/>completion and costs necessary to make the sale and is determined taking into<br/>account marketability, obsolescence and development in expected selling price.<br/><br/>Receivables<br/><br/>Receivables are measured at amortised cost.<br/><br/>Write-down is made for bad debt losses where there is an objective indication that a<br/>receivable or a portfolio of receivables has been impaired. If there is an objective<br/>indication that an individual receivable has been impaired, write-down is made on an<br/>individual basis.<br/><br/>Receivables with no objective indication of individual impairment are assessed for<br/>objective indication of impairment on a portfolio basis. The portfolios are primarily<br/>based on the debtors' registered offices and credit rating in accordance with the<br/>Company's credit risk management policy. The objective indicators used in relation to<br/>portfolios are determined on the basis of historical loss experience.<br/><br/>Write-downs are calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of<br/>receivables and the present value of forecast cash flows, including the realisable value<br/>of any collateral received. The effective interest rate for the individual receivable or<br/>portfolio is used as discount rate.<br/><br/>Prepayments<br/><br/>Prepayments comprise prepayment of costs incurred relating to subsequent financial<br/>years.<br/><br/>Cash and cash equivalents<br/><br/>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term marketable securities with a<br/>term of three months or less which are easily convertible into cash and which are<br/>subject to only an insignificant risk of changes in value.<br/><br/>Corporation tax and deferred tax<br/><br/>Current tax payable and receivable is recognised in the balance sheet as tax<br/>computed on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax on the taxable income of<br/>prior years and for tax paid on account.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary<br/>differences between the carrying amount and the tax value of assets and liabilities<br/>based on the planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability. However, deferred<br/>tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to goodwill non-deductible for<br/>tax purposes and on office premises and other items where the temporary differences<br/>arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either profit/loss or taxable income.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are recognised<br/>at the expected value of their utilisation within the foreseeable future; either as a set-off<br/>against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same<br/>legal tax entity. Any deferred net assets are measured at net realisable value.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates<br/>applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as<br/>current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised<br/>in the income statement or equity, respectively.<br/><br/>Prepayments<br/><br/>Prepayments comprises advance invoicing regarding income in subsequent years.<br/><br/>Liabilities other than provisions<br/><br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the date of borrowing, corresponding to<br/>the proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial<br/>liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.<br/>Accordingly, the difference between cost and the nominal value is recognised in the<br/>income statement over the term of the loan together with interest expenses.<br/><br/>Other liabilities are measured at net realisable value.","Gross profit<br/><br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, the Company has<br/>decided only to disclose gross profit.<br/><br/>Revenue<br/><br/>Income from the sale of goods is recognised in revenue when delivery and transfer of<br/>risk to the buyer have taken place, and the income may be measured reliably and is<br/>expected to be received.<br/><br/>Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration excluding VAT and<br/>taxes charged on behalf of third parties.

The subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation from<br/>the date when they are included in the consolidated financial statements and up to the<br/>date when they are excluded from the consolidation.<br/><br/>The Parent Company is the administrative company for the joint taxation and<br/>accordingly settles all payments of corporation tax to the tax authorities.<br/><br/>On payment of joint taxation contributions, current Danish corporation tax is allocated<br/>between the jointly taxed entities in proportion to their taxable income. Entities with tax<br/>losses receive joint taxation contributions from entities that have used the losses to<br/>reduce their own taxable profit.<br/><br/>Tax for the year comprises current corporation tax for the year and changes in<br/>deferred tax, including changes in tax rates. The tax expense relating to the profit/loss<br/>for the year is recognised in the income statement, and the tax expense relating to<br/>amounts directly recognised in equity is recognised directly in equity.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)<br/>and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under<br/>those standards and requirements are further described in the ""Auditor's<br/>responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements"" section of our report. We are<br/>independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards<br/>Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and<br/>the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other<br/>ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements. We believe<br/>that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a<br/>basis for our opinion.","The annual report of Rokoko Electronics ApS for 2016 has been prepared in<br/>accordance with the provisions applying to reporting class B entities under the Danish<br/>Financial Statements Act.<br/><br/>As from 1 January 2016, the Company has implemented Act no. 738 of 1 June 2015.<br/>This has entailed the following changes to recognition and measurement:<br/><br/>â Going forward, the residual value of intangible assets and property, plant and<br/>equipment must be reassessed on an ongoing basis. Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

The difference<br/>between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the date at which the<br/>receivable or payable arose or was recognised in the latest financial statements is<br/>recognised in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Upon recognition of foreign subsidiaries and associates that are independent entities,<br/>the income statements are translated into Danish kroner at average exchange rates for<br/>the month, and balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the<br/>balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising upon translation of foreign<br/>subsidiaries' opening equity and results at the exchange rates at the balance sheet<br/>date are recognised directly in equity.<br/><br/>Foreign exchange adjustments of balances with independent foreign subsidiaries<br/>considered part of the total investment in the subsidiary are recognised directly in<br/>equity. Similarly, foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and derivative financial<br/>instruments taken out for the purpose of hedging investments in foreign subsidiaries<br/>are recognised directly in equity.<br/><br/>Upon recognition of foreign subsidiaries that are integrated entities, monetary items<br/>are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items<br/>are translated at the exchange rates at the date of acquisition or the date of<br/>subsequent revaluations of the asset.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

If there is an objective<br/>indication that an individual receivable has been impaired, write-down is made on an<br/>individual basis.<br/><br/>Receivables with no objective indication of individual impairment are assessed for<br/>objective indication of impairment on a portfolio basis. The portfolios are primarily<br/>based on the debtors' registered offices and credit rating in accordance with the<br/>Company's credit risk management policy. The objective indicators used in relation to<br/>portfolios are determined on the basis of historical loss experience.<br/><br/>Write-downs are calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of<br/>receivables and the present value of forecast cash flows, including the realisable value<br/>of any collateral received.

However, deferred<br/>tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to goodwill non-deductible for<br/>tax purposes and on office premises and other items where the temporary differences<br/>arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either profit/loss or taxable income.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are recognised<br/>at the expected value of their utilisation within the foreseeable future; either as a set-off<br/>against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same<br/>legal tax entity. Any deferred net assets are measured at net realisable value.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates<br/>applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as<br/>current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised<br/>in the income statement or equity, respectively.<br/><br/>Prepayments<br/><br/>Prepayments comprises advance invoicing regarding income in subsequent years.<br/><br/>Liabilities other than provisions<br/><br/>Financial liabilities are recognised at cost at the date of borrowing, corresponding to<br/>the proceeds received less transaction costs paid. In subsequent periods, the financial<br/>liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.<br/>Accordingly, the difference between cost and the nominal value is recognised in the<br/>income statement over the term of the loan together with interest expenses.<br/><br/>Other liabilities are measured at net realisable value.","Gross profit<br/><br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, the Company has<br/>decided only to disclose gross profit.<br/><br/>Revenue<br/><br/>Income from the sale of goods is recognised in revenue when delivery and transfer of<br/>risk to the buyer have taken place, and the income may be measured reliably and is<br/>expected to be received.<br/><br/>Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration excluding VAT and<br/>taxes charged on behalf of third parties.

Entities with tax<br/>losses receive joint taxation contributions from entities that have used the losses to<br/>reduce their own taxable profit.<br/><br/>Tax for the year comprises current corporation tax for the year and changes in<br/>deferred tax, including changes in tax rates. The tax expense relating to the profit/loss<br/>for the year is recognised in the income statement, and the tax expense relating to<br/>amounts directly recognised in equity is recognised directly in equity.","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)<br/>and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under<br/>those standards and requirements are further described in the ""Auditor's<br/>responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements"" section of our report. We are<br/>independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards<br/>Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and<br/>the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other<br/>ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements. We believe<br/>that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a<br/>basis for our opinion.","The annual report of Rokoko Electronics ApS for 2016 has been prepared in<br/>accordance with the provisions applying to reporting class B entities under the Danish<br/>Financial Statements Act.<br/><br/>As from 1 January 2016, the Company has implemented Act no. 738 of 1 June 2015.<br/>This has entailed the following changes to recognition and measurement:<br/><br/>â Going forward, the residual value of intangible assets and property, plant and<br/>equipment must be reassessed on an ongoing basis. Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Foreign exchange differences arising upon translation of foreign<br/>subsidiaries' opening equity and results at the exchange rates at the balance sheet<br/>date are recognised directly in equity.<br/><br/>Foreign exchange adjustments of balances with independent foreign subsidiaries<br/>considered part of the total investment in the subsidiary are recognised directly in<br/>equity. Similarly, foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and derivative financial<br/>instruments taken out for the purpose of hedging investments in foreign subsidiaries<br/>are recognised directly in equity.<br/><br/>Upon recognition of foreign subsidiaries that are integrated entities, monetary items<br/>are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the<br/>difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the<br/>date of disposal.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the<br/>difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the<br/>date of disposal. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement as other<br/>operating income or other operating costs, respectively.<br/><br/>Impairment of fixed assets<br/><br/>The carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as<br/>equity investments in group entities is subject to an annual test for indications of<br/>impairment other than the decrease in value reflected by depreciation or amortisation.<br/><br/>Impairment tests are conducted of individual assets or groups of assets when there is<br/>an indication that they may be impaired. Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

However, deferred<br/>tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to goodwill non-deductible for<br/>tax purposes and on office premises and other items where the temporary differences<br/>arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either profit/loss or taxable income.<br/><br/>Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are recognised<br/>at the expected value of their utilisation within the foreseeable future; either as a set-off<br/>against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same<br/>legal tax entity. Any deferred net assets are measured at net realisable value.<br/><br/>Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the tax rules and at the tax rates<br/>applicable at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as<br/>current tax.

In subsequent periods, the financial<br/>liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.<br/>Accordingly, the difference between cost and the nominal value is recognised in the<br/>income statement over the term of the loan together with interest expenses.<br/><br/>Other liabilities are measured at net realisable value.","Gross profit<br/><br/>Pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Financial Statements Act, the Company has<br/>decided only to disclose gross profit.<br/><br/>Revenue<br/><br/>Income from the sale of goods is recognised in revenue when delivery and transfer of<br/>risk to the buyer have taken place, and the income may be measured reliably and is<br/>expected to be received.<br/><br/>Revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration excluding VAT and<br/>taxes charged on behalf of third parties.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

The difference<br/>between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the date at which the<br/>receivable or payable arose or was recognised in the latest financial statements is<br/>recognised in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.<br/><br/>Upon recognition of foreign subsidiaries and associates that are independent entities,<br/>the income statements are translated into Danish kroner at average exchange rates for<br/>the month, and balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the<br/>balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising upon translation of foreign<br/>subsidiaries' opening equity and results at the exchange rates at the balance sheet<br/>date are recognised directly in equity.<br/><br/>Foreign exchange adjustments of balances with independent foreign subsidiaries<br/>considered part of the total investment in the subsidiary are recognised directly in<br/>equity.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the<br/>difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the<br/>date of disposal.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the<br/>difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the<br/>date of disposal.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually. Changes are treated as<br/>accounting estimates, and the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively.<br/><br/>Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the<br/>difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carrying amount at the<br/>date of disposal.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Indirect production overheads<br/>and borrowing costs are not recognised in cost.<br/><br/>Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have<br/>different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated<br/>separately.<br/><br/>The basis of depreciation is cost less any projected residual value after the end of the<br/>useful life. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful<br/>life. The estimated useful lives are as follows:<br/>Fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3 years<br/>Leasehold improvements 3-5 years<br/><br/>The useful life and residual value are reassessed annually.

Write-down is made to the recoverable<br/>amount if this is lower than the carrying amount.<br/><br/>The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in<br/>use. The value in use is determined as the present value of the forecast net cash flows<br/>from the use of the asset or the group of assets, including forecast net cash flows from<br/>the disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.<br/><br/>Investments in group entities<br/><br/>Investments in group entities are measured at cost.

Pursuant to the transition<br/>provisions of the Act, any adjustments to residual values must be made<br/>prospectively as an accounting estimate without restatement of comparative figures<br/>and without effect on equity.<br/><br/>â Going forward, an amount corresponding to the capitalised development costs will<br/>be tied to the restricted reserve ""Reserve for development costs"" under equity. The<br/>reserve cannot be used for dividend, distribution or to cover losses. If the<br/>recognised development costs are sold or in other ways excluded from the<br/>Company's operations, the reserve will be dissolved and transferred directly to the<br/>distributable reserves under equity. If the recognised development costs are written<br/>down, the part of the reserve corresponding to the write-down of the developments<br/>costs will be reversed. If a write-down of development costs is subsequently<br/>reversed, the reserve will be re-established. The reserve is reduced by amortisation<br/>of capitalised development costs on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The changes have no monetary effect on the income statement or the balance sheet<br/>for 2016 or for the comparative figures.<br/><br/>Foreign currency translation<br/><br/>On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at<br/>the exchange rates at the transaction date.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to<br/>draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial<br/>statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
