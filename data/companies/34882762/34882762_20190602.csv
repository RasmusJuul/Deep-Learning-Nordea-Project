Revenue from the sale of services is recognised in the income statement provided that transfer of risk to the buyer has taken place before year end. Revenue is measured ex.

Where alternative tax rules, e.g. regarding shares, can be applied to determine the tax base, deferred tax is measured based on the Management's planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryforwards, are recognized at the expected value of their utilisation; either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity.

Revenue from the sale of services is recognised in the income statement provided that transfer of risk to the buyer has taken place before year end. Revenue is measured ex.
