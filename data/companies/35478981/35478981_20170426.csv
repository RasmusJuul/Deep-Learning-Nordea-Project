The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.</p><p>*   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.</p><p>*   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.</p><p>*   Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.</p><p>*   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.</p><p>We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.</p>","<p>Management is responsible for the preparation of Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p><p>In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.</p>",9519.0,RevisionspÃ¥tegning,urn:ofk:oid:23765680,indberetninger-20180424,2.5095897000000003,35478981,,2018-03-27T16:31:26.489Z,2017-04-26T10:08:42.819Z,regnskab,0.0,,2016-12-31,2016-01-01,X17-AG-89-RQ,2017-04-26T10:08:43.066Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
