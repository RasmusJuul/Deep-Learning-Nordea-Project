The procedures selected depend on the  auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of  the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of  financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes  evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates made by the Management, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements.</p><p>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our opinion.</p><p>The audit has not resulted in any qualification.</p>","<p>The Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a  true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such  internal control as the Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation  of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error.</p>",,RevisionspÃ¥tegning,urn:ofk:oid:22213209,indberetninger-20180424,2.509577,35478981,,2018-03-28T18:05:37.316Z,2016-04-13T09:35:19.855Z,regnskab,0.0,,2015-12-31,2015-01-01,X16-AT-91-QB,2016-04-13T09:35:20.034Z,8081541.0,2279.0,80000.0,32279.0,0.0,60630.0,8049262.0,8081541.0,8015068.0,8015068.0,8049262.0,8015068.0,8049262.0,5843.0,5843.0,-19370.0,30000.0,30000.0,
