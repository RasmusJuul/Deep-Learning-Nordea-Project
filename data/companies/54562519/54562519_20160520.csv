The procedures selected depend on the auditorâs judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Companyâs preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companyâs internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">The audit has not resulted in any qualification.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Managementâs Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">Management is responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional disclosure requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act and for preparing Parent Company Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</td></tr></table>","<table xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" style=""border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; width: 650px; border-bottom: 0px; border-collapse: collapse""  width=""100%""><tr><td colspan=""1"">Statement on Managementâs Review</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""1"">We have read Managementâs Review in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
