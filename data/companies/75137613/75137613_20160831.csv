In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Our audit has not resulted in any qualification.","Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and, for such internal control that management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.","Pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have read the Management's review. We have not performed any further procedures in addition to the audit of the financial statements. On this basis, it is our opinion that the information provided in the Management's review is consistent with the financial statements.",,4545474141.0,Managing Director,Chairman,RevisionspÃ¥tegning,,urn:ofk:oid:22932931,indberetninger-20180424,2.3631808999999997,75137613.0,,2018-03-28T18:41:17.331Z,2016-08-31T11:49:47.902Z,regnskab,0.0,,2016-03-31,2015-04-01,X16-BD-33-EB,2016-08-31T11:49:48.295Z,1140310000.0,,,,,,1015950000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
